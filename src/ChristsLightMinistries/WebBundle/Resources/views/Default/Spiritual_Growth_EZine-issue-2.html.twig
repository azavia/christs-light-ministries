This is a place for our visitors to get to know each other, share their successes, failures, frustrations, questions about their spiritual path, and even their personal stories that have made them who they are. This can be done in the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-forums.html">spiritual forums</a>.</p><p>The greatest benefit is that you don't even have to register. Just jump in and begin posting your ideas, opinions, and stories.</p><p>One of the newest forums is the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-journey.html#INV">Spiritual Journey forum</a>, where you can share experiences along your spiritual path, and challenges you might face along the way.</p><p>My biggest goal is to create what I call a virtual spiritual community. Of course nothing can replace face-to-face interaction among people who share similar beliefs, but to be able to open up to others who will encourage and support you instead of judge and condemn you can be so healing. We heavily moderate the posts to make sure that it remains an open, welcoming, supportive environment where people can open up and be themselves.</p><p>Of course, we can't have a community without people. Please share your story, your successes, your frustrations, your challenges, or just your opinions or beliefs. Why not post something after you read this newsletter?</p><p>Also in the community center, we've created a page for <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/contributors.html">our contributors</a>. Of course the first two are <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/christine.html">Christine</a> and <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/brandon.html">me</a>. Then, new to the site, but someone who's been with us in the past, is <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/okoit-b-etyang.html">Okoit B. Etyang</a>.</p><p>On any of our profiles, you can see the pages we've written, and comment on our profiles to ask us questions or give your feedback.</p><p>And, if you want to be a contributor yourself to write on the topics you love, you can <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/contributors.html#INV">request to be a contributor</a> and create your profile page!</p><p>One interesting page that was just added recently is about <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/matrix-energetics.html">Matrix Energetics</a>. Matrix Energetics is a system of healing that has had amazing and instantaneous results. Even if it isn't your primary method of healing, it deserves studying. It was discovered by Dr. Richard Bartlett. Two books on the method that are really enlightening are:</p><p><ul><li><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/amz-matrix-energetics"><em>Matrix Energetics: The Science and Art of Transformation</em></a></li><li><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/amz-physics-miracles" target="_blank"><em>The Physics of Miracles: Tapping in to the Field of Consciousness Potential</em></a></li></ul></p><p>Even if you never use the method itself, these books shed light on the problem of focusing on the disease instead of the solution, which is one of the major reasons that many people are blocked in their attempts to do healing. I would call these must-have books for anyone who wants to do healing seriously. If you have any doubt that it is possible, these books will wipe away that doubt. The pages are full of accounts from people who were miraculously healed without difficulty.</p><p>I just added a page the other day about <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/energy-massage.html">energy massage</a>. My own method might be different from others, but it is a wonderful way to learn how to listen to your intuition, and just to go with the flow, which is the most important part. Massage can be so much more than just a massage; it can heal a person on every level.</p><p>In the news, did you know that May 14 was <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/400year-anniversary-of-the-kjv-bible.html">the 400-year anniversary of the King James Bible</a>? While it's not my favorite translation, I find it interesting nonetheless.</p><p>Finally, last time I talked about our <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-spiritual-counseling">spiritual counseling</a> and <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/sgz-holistic-healing">holistic healing</a>. Now you can see testimonials from people who have actually taken advantage of our services. See <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-counseling-testimonials.html">what people have said about our spiritual counseling</a> as well as <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/holistic-healing-testimonials.html">our holistic healing</a>.</p><p>One of the most touching accounts is this one from Tony: <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/how-spiritual-counseling-restored-my-faith.html">"How spiritual counseling restored my faith."</a></p><p>If you're interested in spiritual growth with the help of a guide to help you to overcome your past issues, resolve past karma, and avoid the pitfalls and temptations of the ego, <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-spiritual-counseling">schedule a session for spiritual counseling</a>. Even one session can help you to better discover your life purpose, where you have come from, even in past lives, and where you are going in the future.</p><p>If you need healing physically, emotionally, mentally, or spiritually, then read about <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/sgz-holistic-healing">holistic healing</a>. We work with the Holy Spirit to know what exactly is the best to do for you and how best to resolve and heal whatever needs to be healed.</p><p>Finally, for those who just simply need prayer, either for yourself or a loved one, please feel free to submit a <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/sgz-request-prayer">prayer request</a>, either publicly or privately. If it is public, then other visitors can pray for you and give you encouragement. If it is private, then Christine and I will pray for you, or optionally, we can call you to pray for you over the phone or Skype.</p><p>If you want to keep updated on all the new content on Christ's Light Ministries, don't forget to subscribe to the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-rss">RSS feed</a>.</p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="daily-inspiration">Daily Inspiration</h2></p><p>We just started a section called <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/daily-inspiration.html"><strong>Daily Inspiration</strong></a>.

I started with simple energy healing. Last year, I was attuned up through to the master level of Reiki. Then, I studied <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/matrix-energetics.html">Matrix Energetics</a>. Since then, I've developed my own system of healing called <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/holistic-healing.html">HEALS (His Eternal and Lifegiving Spirit)</a>.</p><p>Throughout the whole process, I have seen that it doesn't really matter what method of healing you use. Jesus healed quite effectively, and I doubt that He used any particular method. He just healed.</p><p>Now with HEALS, I simply work with the Holy Spirit to bring healing to people, of course along with the angels. However, I've discovered what is the secret to healing. There are several things that are required, but this is the most important.</p><p>True healing requires <strong>love</strong>. I don't mean mere human love; that isn't enough. Human love is limited, conditional, and often selfish (see <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/god-loves-us.html">Why God Loves Us</a> for the difference between God's love and mere human love).</p><p>No, it requires that you channel, express, and become God's love. God's love is so powerful and pure that it does not recognize error or sickness. If there were no barrier between your soul and God's love, you would be completely healed in an instant. Why? Because your soul would recognize its wholeness and fulfillment in God, and would draw healing from that.</p><p>Therefore, your job is to become the manifestation of God's love to the one you are healing. There cannot be any ego in the act of healing. It is a complete selfless act from one to another, or really from one to oneself. It is a gift of God to His creation.</p><p>Does this mean that you have to be perfect in order to heal? Not at all. It only means that you have to completely forget yourself. The more that you can forget yourself in the act of healing, the more that your healing will be effective.</p><p>You must realize that you are love, the person being healed is love, and nothing but love exists. There is such intense love that to think of that person having something wrong with them is ridiculous. You see the goodness, the perfection, the God essence within them.</p><p>And you know what? Healing is more than just an act you perform to another. Healing is a way of life. If you live as a manifestation of God's love, then everyone around you receives healing at every moment of every day. It is promoting life instead of death - health instead of sickness. There is no moment that your soul is not exuding healing through every pore.</p><p>There was a time for a while where any time Christine and I would just be sitting together, just trying to relax, she would begin to be affected by my energy field, and old emotions and issues would begin to come up. it was always very healing, and she would usually have an emotional release, but eventually I had to learn to control my energy so that we could actually do other things, too. But even now, when she is around me, there is a healing effect that she reports. She's been sick lately, and has been coughing a lot. However, she always says that her coughing subsides when I'm holding her.</p><p>It has nothing to do with me. It is merely that I have decided to be a channel of God's love. I'm not always a perfect channel of God's love, but I try to be the best channel that I can be. That is the only way that healing can truly occur. I've certainly learned a lot about the importance of love in healing. For instance, see my article last month on <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/the-healing-love-of-god.html">the healing love of God</a>. This is the love that you must channel in your own life.</p><p>If you want help in learning how to heal, please <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-spiritual-counseling">request spiritual counseling</a> and we can help you to channel God's love.</p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="practice">Practice: Channeling God's Love</h2></p><p>If you started the practice last week of listening to God's voice, how is it going? Please <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/who-is-god.html#INV">post your experience</a> and tell us how you are doing.</p><p>I have just discussed how important it is to channel God's love. But what does this mean for you? How do you channel God's love?</p><p>God's love is the same as the Holy Spirit, for those who believe in such. This is also known as the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit is the manifestation of God's love. Therefore, to channel God's love, or to be filled with God's love, is the same as to be filled by the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The Holy Spirit is God's quiet voice that speaks within your heart, attempting to be heard over the roar of your ego in the world. The Holy Spirit promotes life, healing, health, forgiveness, and love. The Holy Spirit is also a way of life, completely in alignment with love.</p><p>Therefore, the way to channel God's love is to be filled with the Holy Spirit, and to ask that God's love come into your heart.</p><p>Continue the practice from last time. Pray for a few minutes, and then take a few moments to listen, to try to hear God's voice. If you already meditate, continue to meditate if it is working for you.</p><p>However, add this small practice. As you meditate, or listen, open yourself up to God. Open your heart to Him. Pray, or set the intention, to be filled with God's love, or the Spirit of God. Ask that at this moment, you would be filled with the love of God. Then, just allow it to happen. Feel that love flowing into you, filling your heart, sweeping away the darkness.</p><p>In your daily life, begin to think of God more than yourself. You should become less and less important, and God should become more and more important. Instead, it is not so much about what you desire, as what God desires for you. In every decision, choose that which is completely in alignment with God's love for all.</p><p>As you begin to do so, God's love will fill your heart more and more. You will begin to feel the energy of it within you. Sometimes it will overtake you like a wave that sweeps over your entire soul.There are more direct methods, but I don't dare teach them to anyone except those whom I teach directly once they have come far enough. However, this is a very good start that will help you to begin to feel God's love in your daily life. And, as you do, you will express that love towards others, too.</p><p>If you want prayer to help you to be filled with God's love, <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/sgz-request-prayer">submit a prayer request</a>. Alternatively, if you want direct help in learning to have a relationship with God and know His love, <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-spiritual-counseling">submit your request for spiritual counseling</a>.</p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="donate">Support Our Cause</h2></p><p>Christ's Light Ministries is a simple site with simple beginnings, but with a big mission.
