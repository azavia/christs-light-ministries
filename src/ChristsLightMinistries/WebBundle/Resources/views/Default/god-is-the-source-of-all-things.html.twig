        June 28, 2009<br><br>I was lying in bed last night (well on the couch, since I've been sleeping there lately). I had just finished praying, and was trying to settle down to sleep despite my normal nightly fears that I believed I have discussed before. I know they are imagined, but it doesn't make them any less frightening.<br><br>In the midst of all of this, I had a kind of revelation, that was very powerful for me. It's hard to explain, but I will try.<br><br>I was thinking about God, and realized that he is the source and purpose of all things. Everything comes from God, and it is for him that we live and that everything exists.<br><br>It seems like a very minor statement right now, but it was such a revelation and I felt it so personally. I felt God everywhere. I want to be careful with that statement because I don't mean in a new-age sense, at all. I mean that God's presence is everywhere, guiding everything to his ultimate purpose for all of us, and for mankind as a whole. How can we feel lost or alone when he is right there, always with us?<br><br>I felt so much more secure after that. No matter which path I go down, God is there, desiring my greatest good. All I have to do is listen to the guidance of his Spirit, discerning where he wants me to go.<br><br>I don't know if God has a certain path for me in mind, though I certainly hope so and like to think so. I just have to figure out what the Holy Spirit is prompting me to do. That goes for all things, not just my major path in life.<br><br>We have to remember that nothing happens without God's approval, and without him at least permitting it. God has both an ordained will as well as a permissive will. Not all things are ordained, but all things are at least permitted by God. Not a single subatomic particle can move without him permitting it to do so. He is truly the source of all things and guides all things to their ultimate end.<br><br>I just wanted to share. I hope it affects someone else in the way it affected me.<br><br>Brandon

        July 7, 2009<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by <strong>Rev. Brandon A. Olivares</strong></div><br><br>I really want to clarify that when I say I believe the Catholic Church contains the fullness of truth, I'm in no way trying to insult or diminish your own beliefs. You have had many of the same experiences, and even more, than I have had, and it's clear that God has and continues to bless you.</blockquote><br><br>I think Catholics and other Christians can have fellowship in Christ, as you and I do, as long as they try to maintain respect that each is doing their best to be faithful to God. Of course we all believe we are worshiping God in the way we should be or hopefully we would change. And who knows if we may not change as we come to know more by discussing also our differences in beliefs.<br><br>Like I have said before, I am not protesting anything and the protestant label doesn't really fit most non-Catholic Christians. If the Catholic church and it's members believes they have been commissioned by Jesus to do His work on earth, then they can do nothing other than to be going about doing that. That is between them and God and not for me to try and interfere with. <br><br>If I, or others, believe we have also been charged by God with a mission to spread the good news about Christ outside of membership in the Catholic church, then we should also be doing what we are feeling led to do. If the day comes that God says to me, &quot;Become a Catholic&quot; I assure you, I will. But as of yet, all I feel Him saying is that &quot;You are mine and I have a purpose and plan to use you where you are now.&quot;<br><br>Anytime anyone feels at peace with God and in the place where He has called them, that is a blessed thing to experience and for me to behold. That is why I can rejoice with you as you worship God as a Catholic and don't feel any need to try to pull you in another direction. We can both be happy for each other and pray for continued blessings and spiritual growth for each other and leave the where and how of that in God's capable hands.</span>

I, myself, read and listen to Catholic priests speak and have many times felt what they were saying was inspired by God. <br><br>Actually there are very few topics where I don't agree with Catholic doctrines. The main ones where I haven't received any confirmation in my own spirit, probably most specifically the doctrines concerning Mary and some aspects of the teachings about the Pope and priests, are what would keep me from being comfortable as a Catholic myself. <br><br>But if other Christians say Mary has appeared to them or that they know the teachings are true, as long as what Mary said or did is not in conflict with what Jesus has already said, I accept their experiences without judgment. It's just not the way I have known God. <br><br>I am and hopefully will always be open to being corrected by God if I am wrong about this or any other belief I hold. But I am not likely to change that without a message or revelation from God, especially since I don't really see the whole doctrine in the Bible.</span>

        July 7, 2009<br><br>NightSpirit,<br><br>Thank you very much for your post.<br><br>I agree that these scriptures become much more real when eluminated like that.

        July 7, 2009<br><br>I have the same feeling you expressed, that I won't be able to adequately convey my own similar experience either, with the words I have available to me but I will try and you can compare it to yours. <br><br>I was attending a Quaker service because some of my in-laws were members there and were introducing their new baby to the congregation. I was totally enmeshed at the time in my own denominational thinking and really didn't mentally think the people there had anything going on with God, not like we did at our church, of course. <br><br>I was sitting near a window and at the part of the service where they pause and allow the Spirit to move on the people, I turned to look out the window to meditate and pray to God.<br><br>It was literally like blinders fell off my spiritual eyes and suddenly I could see God everywhere. I hadn't connected what I experienced until today but it  may have happened to teach me, just because I had that attitude of God not really being there in that church. Whatever the reason, that day changed me and I dropped some of that judgmental spirit, that spirit that seems to be protecting of the truth but in reality just seeks to limit God, to own and dispense God to whom we approve. &quot;Us four and no more&quot; is a cliché used in protestant circles that describes this clannish like faith in God perfectly. <br><br>While I was praying, I could see God everywhere. First in the trees and the grass, then in the rocks and the bricks, even in the cars and the metal and rubber on the tires. I could see that even though we consider those things &quot;man made&quot; they were only made possible by men manipulating and combining materials that were already created by God and placed here by Him. And I could see that even those inventions would have not been possible without the gifts of wisdom and love and brotherhood that causes people to be able to come together with their ideas.<br><br>As I turned to look at the congregation I had been so questioning of, with they heads bowed, there humbly waiting and focusing on God, tears came to my eyes and a love from God, <i>the love of God </i>, started to flow from me to all those people. I could see some of God in all of them and ever since then, I have tried to see the good, the God in all people. It was like the truth of the verse that He is really not willing that ANY should perish, that He does indeed love all the world and seeks to draw all unto Himself....that word came alive in me that day. <br><br>I &quot;know&quot; He is the Sustainer and Creator of all we know and that He did so because of love. Sounds like from what you said happened to you, we &quot;know&quot; the same God. <br><br>Here is an interesting commentary on some mystical experiences of some non-Christians and Christians, Catholic also, if you would like to look more into how it happens with others, as I have done since my experiences. <br><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/mysticism" target="_blank">Mysticism</a></span>

        July 7, 2009<br><br>When tempted of the devil to turn stones into bread, which certainly Jesus could have done because the written word says all things are possible unto God, Jesus said that men shall live by the words that proceed out of the mouth of God. <br><br>When God illuminates a certain scripture or concept, like He did with you, it is Him speaking that to us as a living word. I don't think every time or even most times He does this that it means we are to &quot;do&quot; anything except allow that word to become part of us and change us as we walk in the truth of it. <br><br>Matthew 4:4 - <font color="blue">But he answered and said,</font> <font color="DarkRed">It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.   </font><br><br>What happened with Emerson, what is happening with these other people of other religions, I do not know and it is not my place to judge another's experiences. Nor are we to live by the revelations of words to others concerning spiritual direction and truth. But we are to seek our own &quot;words&quot; or confirmation from God into our own spirits. <br><br>I understand and respect trusting in the Church's teachings but if that's all people are doing, and it's not, then that would be following a religion made of men and of having a second-hand relationship with God. The same Spirit that teaches church leaders will confirm the truth of what they say to our Spirit. As long as the mystical experiences we have confirm what is being taught, there is no reason to feel conflicted.<br><br>I believe it is possible that people outside the faith, when they have these experiences, are actually receiving a true visitation from God also, as an invitation to seek Him and know more. God <i>is</i> in the Bible, can be found through the Bible, I think most completely. But that doesn't prevent Him from reaching out to all people anywhere in the world. Whether that contact bears the fruit of the Spirit in that person's life would depend on the purity of their own heart and their willingness to follow Him into even more truth.</span>

        July 7, 2009<br><br>That's wonderful, Brandon. It is really difficult to explain sometimes to others how we can &quot;experience&quot; God, how some concept can just come to our understanding and we know it's the truth. It's like we can feel it in every part of us and &quot;know&quot; something without having reasoned it out through mental exercises or study and pondering to reach a conclusion.<br><br>I probably already told you of a time when almost the exact same thing happened to me. This was after the first time I felt the presence of God, as I have described in the <a href="mystical-experiences.html">mystical experiences thread</a>. <br><br>I know what you mean about not wanting to appear new age because I have read of many people who have had a similar revelation of God in all things, people who seem to have no faith or connection to the Christ of the Bible. The most notable of these would be Ralph Waldo Emerson, I think. Mystical experiences such as the one you had, are subject to the interpretation of the person who had the experience and we must try the spirits that we feel against the truth of the Bible. What you are saying is completely biblically sound.<br><br>John 1:3 - <font color="Blue">All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. </font><br>Acts 14:15 -<font color="blue"> And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein: </font>  <br><br>Romans 11:36 - <font color="blue">For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen. </font><br><br>1 Corinthians 8:6 - <font color="blue">But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. </font><br>Colossians 1:16-17 - <font color="blue">For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:  And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.   </font>   <br><br>I could go on with other references. What has happened to you, by way of God himself imparting this knowledge into you, is that when you &quot;read&quot; those words in the Bible you now &quot;know&quot; they are true and no longer have to accept them by faith. This is not just that &quot;hope so&quot; religion we Christians get accused of following. This process of the Spirit of God leading us into all truth, as Jesus promised, occurs many times in our walk with God as insight comes to us and the written word becomes &quot;rhema&quot; or spoken or living word, like bread, into our lives.</span>

We spent some time talking and began going over the questions I had answered on his <a href="http://holistic-healing.christs-light-ministries.org/intake-form.php">form</a>.  Slowly with no pressure we made our way through each one and by the end there had already been a shift.  But the healing did not end there.</p><p>A large focus of the healing is about a shift from living in "ought" or "obligation" to living in "inspiration". The day after the healing session I continued to clean using Hoʻoponopono and also <em>The Work</em>.  That night I had a series of dreams that began with frustration and disturbing feelings.  Each of those dreams was cleaned and by morning, even though there was a line of memories waiting to be cleaned there was an obvious shift….
