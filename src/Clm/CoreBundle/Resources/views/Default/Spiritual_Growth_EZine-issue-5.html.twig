I am so excited to see the development of the Web site as it gains popularity, and seems to be reaching a wider and wider audience.</p><p>This week, Christine and I have fulfilled two major goals and dreams of ours that we have had for a while.</p><p>The first is very personal to both of us, but especially to Christine. You may not know, but Christine is a beautiful singer. She also has a great love for God, and loves to express her love for Him through <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/praise-and-worship-music.html">praise and worship music</a>, which is inspirational, uplifting music that helps you to grow closer to God on your spiritual path.</p><p>Well, now Christine has decided to offer her music on the site. It took a little while to develop the infrastructure for it, but finally we were ready, and we started recording.</p><p>There are only two songs right now, but we are quickly recording and uploading more. These songs can be purchased individually, and are downloadable MP3 files which will be sent to you immediately upon purchase. And remember, you can get 10% off with your exclusive discount code. If you have misplaced it, simply <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/contact.html">email me</a>, and I will give it to you again.</p><p>First is the song <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/all-in-all.html"><strong>All in All</strong></a>. This is a beautiful song that Christine did in a three-part harmony throughout the song. She is of course also playing the piano. <strong>All in All</strong> is all about our dependence on Christ and His strength supporting us in our weakness. It is an inspirational song for anyone no matter your spiritual path. You can <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/all-in-all-sample.html">listen to a sample here</a>.</p><p>The second song is <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/jubilate-coeli.html"><strong>Jubilate Coeli</strong></a>. This is done in a round of three, all sung by Christine. It is short, but so beautiful. <strong>Jubilate Coeli</strong> is an Easter song done in Latin, but is applicable to all times of the year.</p><p>The second major accomplishment this week was my own doing. For a long time, I've been wanting to offer spiritual and religious products to our visitors. Our articles have reached many people, but on the spiritual path, we need certain products as well to aid us in our spiritual practices, worship, and observances. So, finally, I put up a <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/new-age-store.html">store</a>.</p><p>For now, there are mostly new-age products, though there are some products with Christian imagery and symbolism as well. Soon I want to add products from other spiritual paths, but for now I have my hands full adding the products I already do have. I am adding nearly a dozen every day if not more, so keep checking back as I am sure anything you are looking for is either there or will be there soon. YOu can also <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/contact.html">contact me</a> to check if something you are looking for will be available soon, and I will let you know, and update you when it is available if you like.</p><p>Our current products are:</p><p><dl><dt><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/10000-dreams-interpreted-by-gustavus-miller.html"><img src="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/images/B100DREthmb.jpg" alt="10,000 Dreams Interpreted by Gustavus Miller" title="10,000 Dreams Interpreted by Gustavus Miller" border="0"><br>10,000 Dreams Interpreted by Gustavus Miller</a></dt><dd>This comprehensive and thorough study of dreams unravels the cloak of mystery surrounding hundreds of mundane or strange happenings and feelings ...</dd></p><p><dt><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/astral-projection-for-beginner-by-edain-mccoy.html"><img src="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/images/BASTPROBthmb.jpg" alt="Astral Projection for Beginner by Edain McCoy" title="Astral Projection for Beginner by Edain McCoy" border="0"><br>Astral Projection for Beginner by Edain McCoy</a></dt><dd> Gain spiritual understanding and growth as you travel through time, and explore other planets and dimensions.

Therefore, I came up with a compromise.</p><p>I am offering <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/psychic-development-coaching.html">psychic development coaching</a> and <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/holistic-healing-coaching.html">holistic healing coaching</a>. They offer much the same as the schools, though there are limitations on some of the features. However, in this coaching, the compromise is that the student must journal about his or her experience, questions, and progress in the respective schools as they go through the attunements and lessons. The catch is that I am only working with three students through this coaching at a time, so room is extremely limited, and is already mostly full. You can see the list of current students and how many positions if any are open on the pages for each respective form of coaching. Even if the positions are filled, you can sign up and be placed on the waiting list to be added later.</p><p>This is a great opportunity to get a jumpstart in either your healing or psychic development, while still providing great value to our other visitors in sharing your own struggles, pitfalls, experiences, and successes along the way.</p><p>Please remember: if you need prayer, we want to be there for you. Please <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/prayer-request.html">request prayer</a>, and we will pray for you. We will even call you to pray with you if you prefer.</p><p>If you want to keep updated on all the new content on Christ's Light Ministries, don't forget to subscribe to the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-rss">RSS feed</a>.</p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="jesus-messages">Jesus' Latest Messages</h2></p><p><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/jesus-messages.html">Jesus' messages</a> have been by far the most popular section of Christ's Light Ministries. So many people have commented how much they love these messages, and how much they help them. Here is a list of last week's messages, with the link to each. Remember to <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-rss">subscribe to the RSS feed</a> to receive them every day.</p><p><h3>Jesus' Messages</h3><dl><dt><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/jesus-message-84-june-12-2011.html"><b>Jesus' Message #84: June 12, 2011</b></a></dt><dd>Jesus' message says that in the process of the light being revealed within us, our outstanding spiritual issues will be agitated, and may even appear to be worse than ever.

I told you that the intuition is like another sense that you possess, that you must learn how to use. Because you've probably not used it much for years, this may take a while until you learn to trust the information you are receiving through your intuition, but once you do, it can be just like any other sense.</p><p>What you may not realize is that there are several types of intuition. Just as you have different senses that help you to interact with the physical world, so you have many spiritual or psychic intuitive senses that help you to perceive and interact with the spiritual or psychic world.</p><p><h3>The Ethics of Psychic Senses</h3></p><p>Despite what many people say, there is nothing <em>evil</em> whatsoever about these psychic senses. To say this would be like saying that sight or hearing is evil. These psychic senses were given to us by God just like every other sense.</p><p>However, I would like to say a word on spirituality and psychic development. I have met several people who have discarded any kind of committed spiritual path, while pursuing psychic development rather persistently. I believe that this is rather foolhardy, and it is one of the premises behind the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/school-of-psychic-and-spiritual-development.html"><strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong></a>. I strongly believe that psychic and spiritual development are tied hand-in-hand, all but inseparable if you wish to stay on a positive, upward path.</p><p>Why so? As I said, these senses are given to us from God. Along with them often comes a sense of power, and if used incorrectly or immorally, it can lead to great corruption. However, when developed alongside a spiritual path, you must ironically surrender your own desire of power in order to gain the use of it for God's purposes.</p><p>Of course, given the name of our ministry, we are rather God-centered, even Christ-centered, and so this is very important in our work. Even though it might be the tougher path, I believe that it is the only path that will lead to anything beneficial in the long run.</p><p>So are psychic abilities evil? Most certainly <em>not</em>! However, they do ring a certain sense of power, and with power often comes corruption. We must hand that false sense of power over to God, and we will gain the power inherent to the creations of God, making us His true children, possessing all of those things that we were supposed to in the beginning, including these senses, so long as we use them out of unconditional love, and not selfishly.</p><p>Therefore, if you are tempted to develop your psychic abilities, I strongly recommend doing so with the help of a spiritual guide or teacher, such as through our own <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/school-of-psychic-and-spiritual-development.html"><strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong></a>, or even spiritual counseling just to ensure that you aren't going off the right path.</p><p><h3>The Psychic Ladder</h3></p><p>Over the next several weeks, I am going to discuss the various psychic senses. i see these as a hierarchy, and so I will discuss them from the bottom up, as well as tips on how to begin to access these senses. However, please keep in mind that you may very well not be able to access all of these senses, or perhaps can only access one or two of them. This depends both on your own spiritual progress and level of consciousness, as well as your own primary modality, which we will discover later on.</p><p><h4>Clairsentience</h4></p><p>Today, though, I am going to discuss clairsentience. This is the psychic sense of feeling. It is commonly referred to as the <em>gut</em>, as in <strong>feeling something in your gut</strong>.</p><p>It is the easiest to access, and most people do have some access to it, even if they don't realize it. It is the sense that allows you to have a connection with others at all. This connection is called empathy, and can be developed to an advanced level, but everyone has some degree of empathy, or else they could never know what another person was feeling.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how you know what someone else is feeling? It is more than just knowing their facial expressions or body language. I am completely blind, and I can even tell what people are feeling without seeing them, sometimes without them even speaking. How is this possible?</p><p>As humans, we are not just mere bodies. If you are subscribed to this newsletter, I am assuming that you already know this, or are at least coming to realize this. We are free, pure, loving spirits that have chosen to have some time in a body.</p><p>However, even though we are within the body, it does not mean that we are confined to the body. When you begin to recognize and develop your clairsentience, you will realize that you can get a lot more information than just available to your immediate physical senses, and the emotion that another is feeling is one of those things. You can't hear sadness or see fear. You can't taste happiness or smell joy. You cannot touch peace. But yet they are communicated to us from others. We can tell when others are feeling these things more often than not, and this shows a level of transcendence that it seems should not be available to a mere physical body.</p><p>Once you admit this transcendence, then you have opened the door to psychic abilities. Psychic abilities are all about transcending the physical, and gaining information outside of our physical selves, or outside of our present time.</p><p>Why is this necessary? In the physical world, we have been separated. It appears to us that there is this person and that, and they are not the same. It is the world of duality&mdash;of differences.</p><p>God has blessed us with these senses, and the first of these is that of clairsentience. These senses serve to begin to unite us together, and show us that there truly is no separation. If there was separation, how could it be that in a reading, things that you have done in the past or will do in the future can come to my consciousness in the present? We are <em>one</em>, and this is the only answer.</p><p>Clairsentience is available to those who might not be on a spiritual path yet, which is why it is the most common. It is like God's invitation into the higher realms, by giving just a small foretaste of what is available to those who follow. But also, if such a gift was not granted  to those strictly in the physical world, then there would be no bridge to the higher realms. It is like a lifeline that God holds down to us, and beckons to us to hang on and climb up.</p><p>For this reason, clairsentience can sometimes be the most vague of senses. It is still in the world of duality, unlike the other senses, which is often why it appears to warn you of something very bad for you. As you climb this psychic ladder, you will be able to gain clearer and clearer information, as you will see in the coming weeks, but the purpose of this sense is only to grab your attention and give you the most necessary information as quickly as possible.</p><p>Of course, it can be developed beyond this point, and often is, in conjunction with the other senses, but this is the primitive form that the sense takes. However, once you begin to observe the effects of this sense, and see how it works in your life, you will open the door to climbing higher on this psychic ladder.</p><p>As I said, clairsentience often pops up when absolutely needed. For instance, you may be driving home from work when you get the strong feeling not to go down a certain road. Later, you learn that there was a major accident on that road that you would have gotten involved in had you gone down that route. This is your clairsentience kicking in, warning you of information you <em>need</em> to know.</p><p>It may appear when you are able to sign off on a deal, but you just can't get over the feeling you have in the pit of your stomach. Later you learn that there was a major loophole in the contract that would have buried you. This is your clairsentience warning you that this deal may not be good for you.</p><p>It often occurs with mothers. Perhaps you are sleeping, and abruptly wake up with terror in the pit of your stomach, with the urgent feeling that you need to check on your children. This is often the strongest form of clairsentience because of the inherent physical and spiritual relation between a mother and her child.</p><p>You may notice one common thread: it usually feels as though this feeling is in your stomach. Why is this?</p><p>It is because clairsentience resides in your second, sacral chakra, also called the <strong>Svadhishthana Chakra</strong>. This is located an inch or two below the naval, and is the seat of your emotions, desires, and passions. That is also why this sense arises so commonly with high-emotion situations.</p><p>Now that we know what clairsentience is, keep reading to the practice to see how to develop your clairsentience. Then, tune in next week for the next psychic sense: clairaudience, or clear hearing. If you are reading this online or the newsletter has been forwarded to you, don't forget to <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-growth-e-zine.html">subscribe to the <strong>Spiritual Growth E-Zine</strong></a> to keep up to date with this psychic series.</p><p>This is only a fraction of the information that is taught in the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/school-of-psychic-and-spiritual-development.html"><strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong></a>. In the school, I teach you how to develop each of these senses, delve into the specifics of each of them, and so much more. It is the fastest way to go from a complete novice to a professional, and is completely customized to your specific needs.</p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="practice">Practice: Opening the Door to the Psychic World through Clairsentience</h2></p><p>Clairsentience is one of the easiest senses to develop, because you probably already use it, and you may not even know it. Just as last time, I am going to advise that you continue to observe your <em>gut feeling</em> in response to situations and questions. Through the people who have contacted me, I have seen the trend of asking questions that could not be verified. It is not yet time for that until you have developed your psychic sense far enough. For now, stick with things that you can ask and later verify, so that you can get quick feedback and know concretely whether you were right or wrong. With this, there is no in between. If you can't verify that you were right, then it is all but useless until you become more accurate in the future.</p><p>Continue to practice the exercise from the last newsletter. In every situation, see what you feel within you. Pay attention to whether you feel that something is amiss, and if so, trust in your intuition and avoid that situation to correct the problem. The stronger the feeling, the more that you should generally trust in it.</p><p>Other than that, continue to observe your intuition. Come away today with the knowledge and belief that this is no major endeavor. Everyone has this ability, but most people do not know how to use it in a controlled way. This is what I am trying to teach you here. However, the ability is most likely already there, and soon you will be able to turn it off and on like a light switch.</p><p>Therefore, don't go with the belief that this is something you are develop<em>ing</em>, but that this is something that is already present, which you are learning how to control, as a muscle that has not been used for a long time.</p><p>It is important to stay positive, even when you might be wrong, which <em>will</em> happen. Even the best of psychics are not 100% accurate all the time. Take it easy. Play around with this. You are discovering an entire new dimension to your existence, and in doing so, you must be patient with yourself. You are like a toddler taking his or her tentative first steps. You are sure to fall a few times, but don't be tough on yourself, keep going, and pretty soon it will be as natural as using your physical senses.</p><p>Until next time, simply practice. Feel free to ask questions in the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-forums.html">spiritual forums</a>, or discuss your experiences so that others can be encouraged as well. The more people that are discussing this, the more that we all can feel like a community, supporting each other on our individual paths.</p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="donate">Support Our Cause</h2></p><p>Christ's Light Ministries is a simple site with simple beginnings, but with a big mission.
