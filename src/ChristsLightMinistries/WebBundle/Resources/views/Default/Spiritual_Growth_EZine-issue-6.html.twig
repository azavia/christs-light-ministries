We've begun to receive more resistance, and even hate mail and hateful comments, but God is keeping us on the course, and the positive feedback has far outweighed the bad. In fact, I count it a victory that people criticize us, as I should think we were doing something wrong if we weren't ruffling a few feathers.</p><p>I mentioned last week that we have started a new age and metaphysical store. It was in its rudimentary stage last week, with me adding products by hand. However, since then, I have found <a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/3820.html">BigCommerce</a> that allows me to host my store with them. I have been able to import products much more quickly, and I love the features that BigCommerce has, including integration with Google Products, and the ability to post my products on eBay from the admin panel.</p><p>So, now the store is located at <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries-store.org">www.christs-light-ministries-store.org</a>, and we already have 1,000 products, with the hope of adding even more soon. I've already gotten a lot of great feedback on it, and many people seem to really like the products that are offered there.</p><p>Speaking of products, Christine and I have been busy creating our own recordings. To see all of Christ's Light Ministries' products, see <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries-store.org/brands/Christ%27s-Light-Ministries.html">our products in the store</a>.</p><p>So far, here are the songs that Christine has done:</p><p><ul><li><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries-store.org/products/All-in-All.html"><strong>All in All</a><br><em>$1.97</em><br><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/all-in-all-sample.html">Listen to a Sample</a><br><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries-store.org/cart.php?action=add&amp;product_id=924">Add To Cart</a></li><li><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries-store.org/products/Father-of-Lights.html"><strong>Father of Lights</strong></a><br><em>$1.47</em><br><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/father-of-lights-sample.html">Listen to a Sample</a><br><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries-store.org/cart.php?action=add&amp;product_id=985">Add To Cart</a></li><li><strong><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries-store.org/products/Jubilate-Coeli.html" class="">Jubilate Coeli</a></strong><br><em>$0.97</em><br><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/jubilate-coeli-sample.html">Listen to a Sample</a><br><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries-store.org/cart.php?action=add&amp;product_id=923">Add To Cart</a></li></ul></p><p>Every one of those songs is so beautiful, so you can't go wrong with any of them.</p><p>Also, be sure to check out the <strong><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries-store.org/products/Higher-Self-Guided-Meditation.html">Higher Self Guided Meditation</a></strong>.

I've been doing Jesus' Messages for three months now, but I felt the urge to allow people to ask Jesus their own questions. The messages are for the greatest good of everyone, but often people have their own specific questions. People have already taken advantage of this section, and have received very touching and encouraging answers. <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/ask-jesus.html#INV"><strong>Ask your question now.</strong></a></p><p>If you want to keep updated on all the new content on Christ's Light Ministries, don't forget to subscribe to the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-rss">RSS feed</a>.</p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="jesus-messages">Jesus' Latest Messages</h2></p><p><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/jesus-messages.html">Jesus' messages</a> have been by far the most popular section of Christ's Light Ministries.

Last week, I told you about clairsentience, and taught you how to begin to listen to your clairsentient feelings. I showed you that there is really a fine line between what you believe to be simply emotional empathy and real psychic ability, and you will continue to see this as we continue.</p><p>Why is there such a parallel? Because we <em>are</em> naturally psychic. YOu are, too, and every day at that, but you have just turned down the dial to something more manageable for you right now.</p><p>It should be comforting for you to know this. All that you have to do to increase your psychic abilities is to turn up the dial&mdash;turn up the sensitivity on your psychic microphone. And why shouldn't it be like a microphone? It picks up signals from around you and amplifies them for you to pick up more easily. Your psychic microphone is just turned way down so that you can barely pick up anything at all, but it is still plugged in and ready to go.</p><p><h3>Clairaudience: Clear Hearing</h3></p><p>It is pertinent that we are talking about microphones, because today we are about to put that microphone to full use through the audio aspects of your psychic senses. What do I mean by this?</p><p>In the last few weeks, you have been beginning to trust in your intuition. YOu have learned to sense the emotions of those around you, and just <em>feel</em> when something is wrong or different that shouldn't be.</p><p>Today, we will be adding another dimension to this in the way of hearing, instead of just feeling.</p><p>Clairaudience, also called <em>clear hearing</em>, is the ability to <em>hear</em> beyond your regular range of hearing. It is to hear <em>beyond</em> the veil, so to speak. In this sense, you are no longer limited to the mere physical dimension, but can extend your antennae into the spiritual realm.</p><p><h4>Scary…</h4></p><p>This is the first sense where people start to become scared and a little off-put by it. Spirits, and communications from the same, are one of those things best left to professional psychics and mediums, many people believe. If we open ourselves to communications from the other side, who knows what awful things can happen?</p><p>Nevertheless, you have been slowly increasing your psychic sensitivity over the weeks, if you have been following these lessons. In Christine's case, who I have been training personally, her intuition and even her ability to see chakras and auras has taken off in the last week or two, wen this has always been unnatural for her. You should be experiencing similar results, and especially so for those who are in the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/school-of-psychic-and-spiritual-development.html"><strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong></a> already.</p><p>so, like it or not, you have already opened up even a little to the other side. Clairsentience allows otherworldly communication, though only the most vague because of the nature of the sense. Still, it has opened up a channel for your spirit guides and angels to warn you of dangerous situations, people you should not trust, etc.</p><p>Now, we are just bumping it up a notch with a more direct form of communication. The sense of hearing is able to communicate a whole lot more than the sense of feeling, just by its very nature. Every psychic sense that you activate will allow even more direct communication by those who need to get in touch with you.</p><p><h4>Keep in Touch with Your True Home</h4></p><p>There's another thing, too, though. How do you think spirits communicate? They certainly don't have mouths to speak, or ears to hear with. They don't have eyes to see, nor any physical light to provide for any sense of sight.</p><p>No, they communicate in a much more direct fashion: directly to the mind. This might be called telepathy, but in the spirit world it is par for the course of everyday communication. Want to get a message broadcast to a few spirits? Just send it out with those particular beings in mind, and they will receive it instantly. You don't have to keep track of any phone numbers, e-mail addresses or IM handles. Imagine how much faster communication must be when you can communicate in an instant? A few sentences can take 30 seconds to speak, but in the spirit world, all that is instantaneous, faster than the speed of light.</p><p>And, who are you really? Before you are a human, you are a spirit. Many of those spirits on the other side are souls you have probably interacted with possibly for thousands of years, if not longer. Your guides are many times some of your best friends from the other side, even though you don't remember it right now, or at least mentors whom you deeply respect.</p><p>When you remain psychically unreachable, it is like you've moved to a completely different country, and never again call your family or friends from home.</p><p>Remember, you are a spirit, too. These instant forms of communication are natural to you, and that's the only way you communicate when you are not in a physical body. To you, it is strange, but in the spirit world, it is as natural as breathing&mdash;well, I guess they don't do much of that, either.</p><p><h4>Not <em>Just</em> for Spirits</h4></p><p>Clairaudience can also be used with other people here on earth, in the way of <em>telepathy</em>. Telepathy is the ability to communicate from your mind to that of another.</p><p>Telepathy is a completely natural ability, despite its reputation. Spouses often have intense telepathy, because they know each other so well and their energy fields are so intertwined that it is easy to read each other's thoughts. Quite frequently, Christine will say something I was just about to, or the other way around. If you are married or in a serious relationship, I am sure that you've had the experience of being together, but not needing to speak. There is still an interaction of energy, but just on a more subtle level, and not through words.</p><p>However, it can even be done with people you don't know so well, though you might be doing more receiving than sending, since the other person probably won't receive your thoughts unless they are psychic, too. The more that you develop your psychic abilities, the more you will be able to read into another person.</p><p><h3>How It Works</h3></p><p>So now, I'll explain a bit on how this new sense works, and then we'll go into the practice and you will start to work on developing it.</p><p>First of all, it is very unlikely that you are going to hear real, audible voices. It happens sometimes, especially when you are in a deeper state of consciousness, or just drifting off to sleep. You may have had the experience of hearing snippets of conversation when going to sleep, but it doesn't make sense and there's no one around to be having a conversation anyway. Other people hear their name called out just as they begin to drift off. This is all clairaudience.</p><p>However, clairaudience can be better compared to your inner voice. You've heard of that voice before, almost as much as you have heard of the "gut" as with last week. That inner voice is often the direct voice of your intuition, but it is also often the voice of your spirit guides or angels.</p><p>This voice can be difficult to discern at times, because it is usually so silent, and unimposing. The voices of your thoughts far outstrip the silent inner voice. This is why it is so important to learn to quiet your mind, and to differentiate between your thoughts, what I call the voice of your ego, and your true inner voice.</p><p>There is no trick to doing this perfectly, and even those who have been at it for years sometimes have trouble with it. However, you will begin to feel a clear difference between your mere thoughts, and this other voice. For one, your thoughts are usually very demanding and rapid-fire. The inner voice, on the other hand, is silent, and will not speak over the din of your thoughts. It is just an impression barely on the edge of your consciousness, waiting to be heard.</p><p>So that more or less covers clairaudience. In the practice, I will teach you how to begin to develop it. Of course, in this newsletter, I can only give very basic instruction, and the rest is up to you. If you desire to go beyond that, and even to work with someone one-on-one to ensure your progress and growth, then check out the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/school-of-psychic-and-spiritual-development.html"><strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong></a>, where this, as well as all of the other senses, will be taught in much greater detail, and you will be shown how to develop them to a much greater extent.</p><p><hr width="100%" align="left" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="practice">Practice: Tune Up the Psychic Microphone with Clairaudience</h2></p><p>Hopefully you have begun to develop your clairsentience. As I say every week, please share your experiences, challenges, and success in our <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-forums.html">forums</a>. It's the best way to encourage others and be encouraged yourself in your own progress, as well as to get some great advice if and when needed.</p><p>Today we will be working on clairaudience. It will start out very basic, but over time you can begin to be more confident to hear more things.</p><p>But for now, just as before, we will start with yes or no questions. As you ask these questions, you are looking to hear either a yes, or a no. The answer should be immediate. Your spirit guide already knows the answer, so there is no thinking about it or any delay at all. If there is a delay, it is likely your mind doing the answering.</p><p>First, protect yourself. Pray, surround yourself with white light, or whatever is your preferred method of protection. I tend to pray, and ask my angels, especially Archangel Michael to protect me against anything that does not have my highest good in mind. However, do not skimp on this step. Protection is vital as you go deeper into developing your psychic abilities. Make certain that you are well-protected before you continue.</p><p>Now, invite your spirit guide, angel, or whatever you feel most comfortable with to come to you to communicate. You may or may not feel a difference in energy, but if you do, this is a very good sign of your sensitivity.</p><p>Now, ask a question. Start with something that you know the answer to.</p><p><ul><li><blockquote>Is today Thursday?</blockquote></li><li><blockquote>Is my name Socrates?</blockquote></li></ul></p><p>To each question that you ask, you should get an immediate yes or no answer. The voice may sound like nothing at all, like your own voice, or like another voice entirely. You may feel a different energy in the voice. The voice should be calm and loving. If it is critical at all, it is your ego.</p><p>After you have done this for at least a few minutes, getting used to the sound of a yes answer and of a no answer, then begin to ask questions that you don't know, but preferably that you can confirm later.</p><p><ul><li><blockquote>Will it rain today?</blockquote></li><li><blockquote>Will I encounter a lot of traffic on the way to the store?</blockquote></li></ul></p><p>You should get the same feeling from these answers. And remember, there is no such thing as strict future and past on the other side. No, the future isn't completely set, but your guide should be able to answer simple questions like those about the immediate future.</p><p>Practice this for a day or two, until you get used to it, and your accuracy gets better. Practice it for 3, 4, 5 days if you have to.</p><p>After you have become assured of your accuracy, then you can move into questions that you don't know the answer to, and can't really know the answer to.</p><p>After all of this, you can begin to ask other simple questions. By now you should be more accurate with the yes and no questions. Perhaps ask how many spirit guides you have. Ask questions that can have one or two word answers, and then continue to make it more complex until you can essentially have a conversation with your guide.</p><p>It is a process that you must be patient with, but if you continue to work at it, you <em>will</em> get there. As I have said, if you want to work on developing this with someone to help you, sign up for the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/school-of-psychic-and-spiritual-development.html"><strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong></a>, and you will be assured of developing your psychic abilities.</p><p>You are sure to have a lot of interesting experiences this week as you work on developing this new sense. Please share your experiences, challenges and successes on the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-forums.html">forums</a>. i would love to hear about your

width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="partners">Our Partners</h2></p><p>As <strong>Christ's Light Ministries</strong> grows, we work with partners who make our job easier, and provide products and services that we need in order to run this ministry even more efficiently so we can focus on what is important. These partners have truly been great, so I would like to point them out and tell you a bit about them.</p><p><h3><a href="http://buildit.sitesell.com/azavia.html" target="_blank">Site Build It! Your Path to a Successful Online Business</a></h3></p><p>In August, 2010, Christine and I started what was then called The Full Effect. Our dream was to create a ministry that would bring healing to others.</p><p>Since then, the vision has grown and improved into what it is today, <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/"><strong>Christ's Light Ministries</strong></a>.</p><p>When I began <strong>Christ's Light Ministries</strong>, I wanted to ensure that it was successful. The Full Effect had meager success, and I just didn't have the knowledge or resources to market it properly. We got some visitors, but they were mostly spammers.</p><p>So, with the renewed vision, i wanted a renewed effort to make it succeed. Of course, I trusted in God to help us, but I knew that I had to do something on my end, too.</p><p>Sure enough, God started to put <a href="http://buildit.sitesell.com/azavia.html">Site Build It!</a> in our path. I had come across it a few years back, but in my pride of being an accomplished programmer, dismissed it as a solution only for beginners to the Web.</p><p>But now, I took a fresh look at it, recognizing my own ignorance of marketing, search engine optimization, etc. This solution claimed to do all of that for me, and more.</p><p>So, I took the tentative step of signing up for <a href="http://buildit.sitesell.com/azavia.html">Site Build It!</a> on April 29, and officially launched the site on May 1, after reading through their very detailed Action Guide, which gave me all the steps to creating a successful Web site.</p><p>They emphasize that the important part was to create new, unique, and engaging content for my Web site, which I have done ever since, having now over 300-400 pages. It would take care of the rest, and teach me to do my part, too.</p><p>And, <a href="http://buildit.sitesell.com/azavia.html">Site Build It!</a> has certainly delivered. It has only been a month and a half, but here are our statistics for June 22, 2011:</p><p><dl><dt>Visits</dt><dd>474</dd><dt>Unique Visitors</dt><dd>268</dt><dt>Page Views</dt><dd>1,127</dd></dl></p><p>This is only after about a month and a half, and it is growing steadily. Meanwhile, others I have spoken to have only received 50-100 visitors a day even six months after starting.</p><p>We've already received many customers, and people who participate in the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-forums.html">forums</a>. I've had more clients now than I ever have, and people seem to love the Web site.</p><p>But, I can honestly say that I couldn't have had nearly this success if it weren't for <a href="http://buildit.sitesell.com/azavia.html">Site Build It!</a></p><p><h3><a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/3820.html">BigCommerce: Get Your Store Up in Minutes</a></h3></p><p>I just signed up for <a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/3820.html">BigCommerce</a> recently, but already it has been great.</p><p>I had been looking for a good solution for my store. I tried Amazon Web Store, but it was inaccessible to my screen reader, so that was out the window. I explored some other solutions, and finally landed on <a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/3820.html">BigCommerce</a>.</p><p>I had a database of all of our products, but no way to upload them until then. However, with <a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/3820.html">BigCommerce</a>, I was able to upload my products in a simple and flexible format. I added hundreds of products in a matter of minutes, while I was adding one at a time before.</p><p>There are so many features that I like, that it is hard to know where to start.</p><p>They firstly integrate with many payment gateways, and even have their own gateway that allows you to accept credit cards, if you have a business checking account. I got signed up with that right away, and am accepting PayPal as well.</p><p>The Web interface is very flexible, but the default is very nice as well, which I like so that I don't have to get a designer involved, which costs more money, of course.</p><p>In every way, it just feels like a big retail store, but really <a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/3820.html">BigCommerce</a> is not that expensive at all.</p><p>They have so many marketing tools, all of which are great. My favorites so far are the integration with Google Products, and especially the ability to post products to eBay and keep track of the listings. You just create listing templates with all of the specifications for the listings, and then post all the products you want.</p><p>They also have an e-mail marketing section with integration with several services, including iContact and others. I have not explored these options yet, but it looks very promising.</p><p>It has great handling of shipping, shipping methods and calculations. You can either select to calculate quotes in real time, or set your own rules for shipping prices.</p><p>It has the most robust handling for taxes that I have ever seen before, so it will handle just about any problem you can throw at it.</p><p>Finally, there are wonderful features for discounts and coupons, which are very flexible. You can create discounts for anything you like and according to any conditions.</p><p>They of course handle all of the search engine optimization, though it is strongly suggested that you take advantage of the fields for keywords and descriptions under each page, category and product to make it even better.</p><p>I've only just begun with this store, so I don't have any stats, but I truly believe that it will be just as successful as the main site has been, if not more so.</p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="donate">Support Our Cause</h2></p><p>Christ's Light Ministries is a simple site with simple beginnings, but with a big mission.
