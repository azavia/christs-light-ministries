        June 19, 2009<br><br>We do believe that Jesus gave gifts and offices to the church as in 2 Corinthians 12 and we respect those offices and the people who serve others who may be weak in faith or in a crisis. <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>1 Corinthians 12:28 - And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues<br><br>Ephesians 4:11 - And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;   <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>So a protestant who doesn't feel at peace with God concerning sin does have available to them spiritual help and counsel from other Christians, pastors, teachers, etc. <br><br>I understand why Catholics believe as they do, that Peter was ordained by Jesus to establish a new organization, with priests and rituals, as earthly points of contact with Jesus. I have no problem with that because I believe those things may be physical expressions that convey the same underlying spiritual principles, that is, it is ultimately our faith in the power of Jesus to cleanse and forgive us that saves us.  <br><br>I would be willing to go more into why Protestants do not feel they need a priest or a Pope, along with supporting biblical references but I don't think this is the thread for it, since that is more of a debate. <br><br>But I get your point, that you believe a person with an absolution from a priest, because of the belief in the priest as a representitive of Christ, can have a more physical assurance of salvation than a protestant. <br><br>Whereas, protestants have faith that Jesus hears us and sees the intent of our hearts when we confess directly to Him and we accept His forgiveness by faith. We place our confidence in the Bible, which says this is true. And we also have confidence in the power of God's spirit to guide each of us individually, as sons, and to bear witness with our spirit that we are forgiven.</span>

        June 19, 2009<br><br>I think you are correct that God's nature doesn't change but I believe His methods or symbols, have and do change. <br><br>Briefly, protestants feel that the purpose of the temple was to offer blood sacrifices and were established as foretelling of Christ. When Christ came and was sacrificed, as the lamb of God, protestants believe the purpose of the temple and the priesthood was fulfilled so they are no longer needed. When the veil of the temple was torn asunder supernaturally after the crucifixation, we see that as symobolic of the end of any separation or mediator needed between God and man, except Jesus. The protestant term used is the &quot;priesthood of the believer&quot; which is based on their interpretation of the new covenant.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Hebrews 8: 7-11<br><br>7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. <br><br>8 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: <br><br>9 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.<br><br><br>10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: <br><br>11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>

        June 18, 2009<br><br>I think the question in this thread still stands though.<br><br>I was thinking that God has always provided some physical representation. Remember the pillar of cloud and of fire that God used to lead the Jews? And how exact God was about the specifications of the temple, and about the ritual around that temple, e.g., only the priest being able to go into certain areas. And the physical representation of the Jews' sins, atoned by sacrifice, also as a pointer to the perfect sacrifice that would soon come. Also, he always appointed a lead profit or king to lead the Jews.<br><br>God's nature does not change, so it makes sense to me that he would have similar physical representations today.<br><br>In terms of knowing one is saved, well I think to confession, where there's a physical representation to assure one of one's forgiveness, because it is actually spoken. Jesus left 2,000 years ago, but he left us a line of bishops, in order to guide us, just as the apostles were the driving force behind the Church 2,000 years ago. There are many other parallels I see, but they aren't really related to this thread.<br><br>God knows that we are physical beings, and it is a lot easier for us to have faith when he deals in the physical as well. That's the whole idea behind the sacraments, I think.<br><br>Those are only my thoughts, and would be curious what others think.</span>

        June 10, 2009<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by Rev. Brandon A. Olivares</div><br><br>Ah yes, I learned this recently. There was another forum where Christians are not so welcome <img src="/images/wink.png" border="0" alt="Wink" title="Wink">, and I learned that arguing with someone else will never convert them. I think that for everyone, there is a time when they are ready. Until then, they will reject everything from God, even if Jesus would appear right in front of them.<br><br>I never recall one person being willingly converted through debate and argument. It takes personal searching and a willingness to be open to the truth, no matter what it might be.</blockquote><br><br>I think sometimes we, the Christians, let our ego take over and help create those arguments though. And even if it appears they are not ready now, God can bring to mind what they have heard at a later time. Remember Saul was once killing Christians before being converted to Apostle Paul so we don't always know what God will do with a person in the future. <br><br>My own conversion was a sum of different conversations with Christians who took it on themselves to dispute and challenge me in my beliefs. Many of them were probably dead before the words they had sown into me took root and grew. One plants, another waters, then God gives the increase. You may think you failed in that spreading of seeds and 4 out of 5 times, it will fail, according to the parable of the sower, but that 5th time makes all the others worth it. <br><br>The irritation, frustration, tit for tat, all coming from expectations, ego and making judgments is what we need to stop. As long as someone is willing to be engaged in a conversation, listening and responding, and as long as we ourselves feel love and compassion toward the person, I think it can still be good.  <br><br>I know I've often been guilty of getting over into ego, especially with those who want proof, proof and more proof but then throw out all my personal accounts of miracles and encounters with God. But the New Testament says people turned away and left Jesus even after they had seen Him raise the dead. So it <i>is</i> egotistical of me to get offended when someone doesn't believe my little miracle stories. <br><br>We <i>can</i> save ourselves some grief by being more in tune to His leading us to the ones He is drawing. Sometimes it comes as just a nudge to strike up a conversation with a stranger. But there are also times to not throw your pearls before swine and even to wipe the dust off your feet and move on, both sayings of Jesus, so maybe that's what happened there with you.</span>

        June 10, 2009<br><br><blockquote>Originally Posted by BornAgain  <br>Jesus is not the Lord of all but only to those who obey him in word and deed, those who worship him in Spirit and truth, period. The sooner we accept that the easier it shall be for us</blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by Ned</div><br><br>Jesus is either God or he is not. If he is God, than he is God of all. Some people may reject him, but that does not remove him from being God.</blockquote><br><br>I can agree with both of these statements. Jesus is God of all creation but He is only Lord to those who accept and follow Him. While He is our God when we are physically born, it requires a bowing of the knee and surrender to Him for it to be true that He is our Lord or for us to be &quot;born again.&quot;<br><br>I think this came from the discussion about hell and maybe BornAgain thought we were taking liberties. In a nutshell, we were saying that since a person must be drawn by the spirit to come to Jesus, then those who have never heard of Jesus can't bow to Him and don't seem to have been guilty of anything worthy of hell. <br><br>The usual answer is that we are born already condemned to hell because of Adam. That discussion could lead to a whole lot of other directions, like whether it is God who must send the word to the limited amount of people He may be drawing or whether who will hear or not hear about Jesus rests on us. <br><br>&quot;God would have all men to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth.&quot;<br>Has God really left the fate of the millions of those souls to us?  Is it hellfire for those we really want to tell about Jesus and who want to know the truth but don't have the resources and abilities to reach? Or might there be more to the plan of the just and merciful God who loved us so much that He sent Jesus in the first place?<br><br>Since you are evangelical, BornAgain, what are your thoughts on this?</span>

However, to belittle another's beliefs here is unacceptable. Instead of accusing the Catholic Church of not following Christ's teachings, a better approach is to say you don't understand why the Catholic Church teaches certain things or has certain practices. Then a civilized discussion can be started.</span>

There are various gods in the Bible up to and including the stomach is identified as a god to some. God to me then is anything that one worships as having power to control one's destiny and Jesus is taken within these context by a specific group of people but not all.<br><br>Most religions give their reverence to objects made by their hands and still believe in them as their deity which is Biblical anyway and their right of choice.

Maybe I should ask that in another thread? Lol.<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by NightSpirit</div><br><br>Agreed. When the Bible says that those who &quot;believed not&quot; are condemned already or as in John 3:19 - And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil - I think that implies an actual rejection after knowing the truth. It's sometimes hard for us to accept that some people do &quot;love darkness.&quot;</blockquote><br><br>Indeed. I was surprised recently to learn that some people explicitly believe and call on Satan, knowing he is total darkness. I was baffled, but that's how it is.<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by NightSpirit</div><br><br>I think that no one being able to come to Jesus unless they are being drawn by God, is why we shouldn't get irritated with those who don't believe what we believe (and why I wasn't worried went I sent you that email.) We can't and shouldn't try to convince anyone we are right and they are wrong for not agreeing but pray that the Spirit will draw them and maybe use us to speak what the Spirit wants them to know.</blockquote><br><br>Ah yes, I learned this recently. There was another forum where Christians are not so welcome <img src="/images/wink.png" border="0" alt="Wink" title="Wink">, and I learned that arguing with someone else will never convert them. I think that for everyone, there is a time when they are ready. Until then, they will reject everything from God, even if Jesus would appear right in front of them.<br><br>I never recall one person being willingly converted through debate and argument. It takes personal searching and a willingness to be open to the truth, no matter what it might be.</span>

I have had your same experience, where each time I would leave Christianity, my time away from it would get shorter and shorter each time. Last time it was only about three months before I was feeling that pull back.<br><br>Jesus says that no one can come to him unless the Father draws in that person.<br><blockquote>John 6:44 (NAB)<br><br>[44]*No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draw him, and I will raise him on the last day.<br><br>John 6:65 (NAB)<br><br>[65]*And he said, “For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father.”<br></blockquote><br><br>So maybe once God selects us, and he knows that we are capable of knowing the truth and serving him, well he doesn't let go so easily? What rule free will plays in this, I'm not sure. I'm sure one could continue to ignore that pulling back to God, but I think one would then become unhappy and lost.</blockquote><br><br>I think that no one being able to come to Jesus unless they are being drawn by God, is why we shouldn't get irritated with those who don't believe what we believe (and why I wasn't worried went I sent you that email.) We can't and shouldn't try to convince anyone we are right and they are wrong for not agreeing but pray that the Spirit will draw them and maybe use us to speak what the Spirit wants them to know.</span>

        June 9, 2009<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by Okoit B. Etyang</div><br><br>The key word here is &#8216;being&#8217; saved this point out an on-going process which is being saved from the PRESENCE OF SIN in other words the process of deliverance whereby a person character is being changed to conform to God given standards. And finally there is<br><br>Here the Bible talks of the eventual outcome by which those who would have persevered to the end through temptations shall be saved from the wrath of God (don&#8217;t ask me how though).</blockquote><br><br>The Bible speaks of salvation in many different tenses, some past, as above(&quot;have been&quot; saved) some present tense (like those you quoted) and some future, (as in &quot;will be saved&quot;.) Because of those tenses, there have arisen many opinions on, not how we are saved (it is clear that it by Jesus) but on the steps of that process.<br><br>I can see why Catholics may have questions on what it means to be &quot;born again&quot;, since differing doctrines have been assumed, sometimes from the same verses. <br><br>In most of the protestant branches I attended, salvation is explained like this. When we are first saved, our spirit, the part of us that is eternal and will return to God, is saved. Our nature is changed and we are reconciled to God at that point. Because our soul, which is our ego and personality, and our flesh or body, has had control over our lives prior to salvation, we must learn a new walk, while the Holy Spirit teaches us and we learn to listen and follow his leading.  The final salvation, spoken of in the future tense, usually refers to the salvation of our bodies when Jesus returns and changes this corruptible flesh to the likeness of His incorruptible flesh. <br><br>I have read that the Aramaic language of that day was lacking terms to easily describe tenses. I think it was maybe not an accident that Jesus chose that time and language for His message. I think, from the context of many things He said, that He wanted us to live our lives as if it is how we live today...this day...in the now...is what matters to our salvation.  <br><br>Whether our theology is that we are saved once and on our way to heaven, saved daily, or saved when we get to the end, we can all be assured that we were, are and will be saved if we remain as close as possible to Jesus, in word and deed, every day, especially this day.   <br><br>Thanks for the response and feel free to differ with me anytime. Iron sharpens iron and I love a chance to learn and grow.</span>

That we are not really completely &quot;saved&quot; until we have endured until the end? If you are saying that salvation consist of a beginning event, a continuing process and an concluding event that sounds alright to me. <br><br>My point was that salvation is taught by many protestants as a one-time event, leaving many to doubt their salvation if that beginning event was not as dramatic or the same as someone else's experience. <br><br><blockquote>For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith&#8212;and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God. EPHESIANS 2:8</blockquote><br><br>The key words here I would like you to notice is &quot;have been.&quot; A gift of which we then have to earn the remainder? Or a gift that is being held in trust until we show we have been worthy of until the day we die? <br><br>Most people, hopefully you too, have noted that the writers of the New Testament seem to put different emphasis on the role of works in &quot;being&quot; saved. Paul talks about it in Romans and Galatians. James said show your faith by your works.</span>

Etyang</div><br><br>Can you then assist me/us understand the beginning, purpose and the Christ likeness in the rosary, worship of Mary (mother of God), the presence of idols in the Church and the Pope.</blockquote><br><br>I don't know if I can assist you but maybe you can assist me. Maybe you can explain to me how those things you listed, the believing or practicing of which could cancel or contravene a &quot;true faith in Jesus.&quot; <br><br>Although I am not a Catholic, I will try to give you my basic understanding of those practices and try to explain why I think, even if I may not agree that the practice is necessary, it is not evil and maybe even good.<br><br>Rosary - as I understand it, the rosary began as an assistance to help lay people, many of whom may not have been able to read or had access to a Bible, in the memorization of certain helpful scriptures and of details of the lives of Jesus and Mary. Taking time out to meditate on Christ, the Lord's prayer and such certainly doesn't seem to be against Christ and since many people say they are blessed with a greater sense of peace through it, it's seems okay to me.  There are some comparable rituals in many protestant churches that bring peace, like the placing of big wooden crosses or the wearing of small diamond ones, the use of devotionals in daily prayer or even the use of altars for more dedicated praying.<br><br>Worship of Mary - As God or as the Son of God?  I don't think they do that. There may be some orders that hold a greater respect for Mary than others but I am not aware of any that consider her significance to be above our relationship with Christ or the Holy Spirit or the Father.<br><br>Idols - Artwork in the church are only idols if people think the artwork is a god and are worshiping it. Protestant churches have pictures of Jesus or doves or crosses or altars. Any of these things, even the building itself, can become idol if worshiped.<br><br>The Pope - is the leader of the Catholic church, a man. All churches have leaders they respect and look to for leadership and a message or word from God.<br><br>I do not think any certain church has a perfectly correct theology and I don't believe it is necessary to be perfectly correct about anything but Jesus to be &quot;saved&quot; by Him. I think the Catholics are correct about Jesus and that many of them are surrendered to Him and actively seek to be transformed into His likeness.</span>

No one worships Mary. Those aren't idols in Catholic churches. And the rosary is a meditation on the Gospel, starting with the immaculate conception to Christ's resurrection and the assumption of Mary.

This authority continued down the line of popes, even to today.<br><br>However, allow me to note that this thread is for the discussion of salvation and how one knows one is saved, and not discussion about the practices of the Catholic Church. If you want, you can start another thread to talk about that.<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by Okoit B.

        June 8, 2009<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by NightSpirit</div><br><br>I don't think the Bible specifies whether salvation has to happen instantly or whether we can also come to believe gradually, through observations and studying the Bible. At some point we do have to become aware of our sins and turn to Jesus for forgiveness.  We do have to believe what the Holy Spirit is speaking to our hearts about Jesus, as the Christ and God's Son, and believe it enough to speak it. Trying to put that miracle into a formula is where I think our traditions get in the way and cause doubts and unneccesary burdens for people.  .</blockquote><br><br>I beg to disagree with your opinion; it is well defined in the Bible on how one receives salvation and then lives a life of salvation and finally maintains the same and here are the verses to prove that;<br><br><blockquote>For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God. EPHESIANS 2:8<br><br>Who has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time. 2 TIMOTHY 1:9.</blockquote><br><br>The two verses above indicate at the beginning of the process of salvation where by we are saved from the POWER OF SIN. Here we identify that we are sinners and fall short of the glory of God thus the need for seeking for forgiveness.<br><br><blockquote>Praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved. ACTS 2: 47.<br><br>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 1 CORINTHIANS 1: 18.</blockquote><br><br>The key word here is ‘being’ saved this point out an on-going process which is being saved from the PRESENCE OF SIN in other words the process of deliverance whereby a person character is being changed to conform to God given standards. And finally there is;<br><blockquote>Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him! For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life! ROMANS 5: 9,10.<br>And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. ROMANS 13:11.</blockquote><br><br>Here the Bible talks of the eventual outcome by which those who would have persevered to the end through temptations shall be saved from the wrath of God (don’t ask me how though).</span>

There is so much more to it than that. <br><br>Most of us have that experience, that acceptance of who Jesus is and an awareness of God's love for us, usually before we have even read the whole Bible. We can come to believe either as a result of hearing a sermon or from testimony from another Christian, even from a dream or vision. After we receive His Spirit and He begins to teach us, we believe more of the Bible because what is written there happens or begins to happen in us.<br><br><blockquote>Romans 8 - For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.  For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.  The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</blockquote><br><br>I know this. I know God is my Father and Jesus is His Son who took away the sins of the world, mine included. And when I read it there in the Bible, I knew the Apostle and I had an experience with the same God. <br><br>We all may not know the whole Bible yet and our habits may not change as quickly as our desire to be like Jesus. We may need counsel or help from other Christians or a priest or pastor. But because Jesus is the author and finisher of our faith, we can sense He is with us. <br><br>When He ministered here on earth, Jesus didn't speak so much about specific sins, especially to the prostitutes, thieves, drunkards and such. He said He wasn't sent to condemn. &quot;Go your way and sin no more, neither do I condemn you, those who are forgiven much, love much, etc.&quot; He told us that neither sin nor holiness originates from the outside but from within. That's where He starts with us knowing that what's in our heart will come out our mouth and manifest in our lives. (Matthew 15, Mark 7). <br><br>Briefly, there are different beliefs on whether salvation is a one time done deal or whether it is a continuing process, whether one can be lost again after coming to believe in Christ. <br><br>In my own personal experience, there have been times that I left the church and left off practicing my faith, even to the point of living sinfully. Not something I'm proud of but it happened. I never felt Jesus left me during those times, though and I've been brought back more than once, even closer to him, like the lamb He left the flock to find and then put on his shoulders in Luke 15. Maybe we <i>can</i> utterly forsake Him but I tend to lean toward the idea that once we are born again, we are His family and He doesn't let us go so easily.</span>

        June 8, 2009<br><br>From a personal assurance standpoint of our salvation, I think that comes to all Christians the same way, through a witness in our own spirit. <br><br><blockquote>Romans 10: 9-13  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</blockquote><br><br>If we have done that and still have doubts, if we don't become more at peace with God, it may be an attack by the enemy trying to steal the seed that is within us. There is nothing wrong, IMO, with asking God for assurance or confirmation. When the spirit of God does confirm His presence, either inwardly and sometimes through an outward miracle, it does fully answer the question for that person. For me, He confirmed it through an experience similar to those described in Acts 2 and Acts 10, separate from the time I first believed and confessed that He was Christ, separate from my water baptism. Most people who have had it happen like that call it a baptism in the Holy Spirit.   <br><br>The book of 1 John goes into some detail into how we know we are saved by the way we feel and think. There are many &quot;we knows&quot; in those chapters and it's good to place check our experience against what John says. Here are some of them.<br><br><blockquote>We <u>know</u> that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. <br><br>My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.  And hereby we <u>know</u> that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. <br><br>For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.  Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. <br><br>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</blockquote><br><br>So we can see, by these criteria, it is clear that Catholics and non-Catholics, if they are believers and followers of Jesus Christ, are saved. <br><br>And Jesus said in John 13:35 - By this shall all men <u>know</u> that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.  There are other things he could have added here and I am not saying they are trivial, such as confession, baptism and works, just that this seems most important in identifying who is actually His.</span>

        <br><span class="subBodyText">
        June 8, 2009<br><br>Just FYI, but there is actually some resistance within non-Catholic circles to the label &quot;protestant.&quot; It really no longer applies as a descriptive term since we are so far removed from 1529 and most Christians are not really protesting the Catholic church or anything for that matter. <br><br>It does seem to be a little of a divisive term but that's just human, I guess. One of the churches I used to attend changed it's name recently from &quot;full gospel.&quot; I don't know why they did it but that's another possibly divisive term, implying by the distinction that other churches are following &quot;less than&quot; the full gospel.  <br><br>There do still exist churches that are proud of the Protestant label, (just like some southerners still call themselves rebels) and feel it's their duty to &quot;protest&quot; Catholic doctrine. To those denominations, because of a limited understanding of the true faith most Catholics have in Jesus, a person is considered either Catholic or Christian, but not both, to imply that Catholics don't know Christ.<br><br>As related to the OP, those attitudes mostly come from differences in beliefs of who has really met the qualifications to be called &quot;saved.&quot; To be able to pinpoint a definite day when we came to understand and believe, to know a change took place, with a baptism following, is required for salvation to some  fundamental &quot;protestant&quot; churches.  <br><br>I don't think the Bible specifies whether salvation has to happen instantly or whether we can also come to believe gradually, through observations and studying the Bible. At some point we do have to become aware of our sins and turn to Jesus for forgiveness.  We do have to believe what the Holy Spirit is speaking to our hearts about Jesus, as the Christ and God's Son, and believe it enough to speak it. Trying to put that miracle into a formula is where I think our traditions get in the way and cause doubts and unneccesary burdens for people.</span>

Only can manage two.<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by Ned</div><br><br>I know this may seem like a no-brainer, but what do you consider to be the Word of God?</blockquote><br><br>The Holy Word of God as written in the Bible by inspired men of God plus its revelations and interpretations by appointed servants of God, by servants I do mean;<br><br>This is why it says: <br>&quot;When he ascended on high, <br>he led captives in his train <br>and gave gifts to men.&quot;(What does &quot;he ascended&quot; mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions? He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.) It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. <b>EPHESIANS 4: 8-13.</b><br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by Ned</div><br><br>I'm not sure I quite understand what you are saying here... if a doctrine is rooted in Biblical principles, would it not follow that the doctrine is there to help people live in imitation of Christ?</blockquote><br><br>Imitating Jesus requires consistent obedience to a specific system of life as lived and taught by the Lord himself. All doctrines then must have a Biblical proof as its validity and strict adherence to the foundation of the Christian belief and way of life.<br>I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you, as my dear children. Even though you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel. Therefore I urge you to imitate me. For this reason I am sending to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church. 1 CORINTHIANS 4: 14-17.</span>

I do not think that the protestant way of asking for forgiveness is one sided based on these verses;<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.</font><b> Luke 6:37. </b><br>Firstly, we should as Christian’s have confidence that as we forgive we are bound to be forgiven, it is sort of reciprocal and not one sided for once we know that we are unable to forgive then we automatically must understand that we will not be forgiven. Secondly, those who are the true disciples of Jesus must be under the guidance or rather be filled by the Spirit of God and which through God always convinces us that we are truly forgiven;<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.</font><b> John 14:26</b><br>Thirdly all those that are in Christ have full assurance and suffer no condemnation personal or otherwise;<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man, in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit.</font><br><b>ROMANS 8: 1- 4</b>.<br>The Holy Spirit is therefore the only God given evidence of the forgiveness of sin and Christ’s only witness to forgiveness of sin and validity of salvation. I understand for the need of a physical evidence you are pointing out, but unless you fulfill the predetermined concepts of forgiveness and live within the required expectations, it will count to nothing but just a ceremony that has no positive sacred significance to you’re your spiritual person.</span>

For one to qualify to be considered as belonging to God then it is demanded that ones life must be a replication of that of Christ, differences always arise when people choose to belong to religions and denominations with disregard to the principles and tenets as commanded by the Word of God.</blockquote><br><br>I know this may seem like a no-brainer, but what do you consider to be the Word of God?<br><br><blockquote>It is thus instructive to say that doctrines and dogmas that do have its roots and purpose defended by the Bible should not be used as a measure of expectations of life in Christ. Salvation must be predetermined by given and provided a requisite in the Word of God and it is the only way to seeing God thus it is expected of every person;</blockquote><br><br>I'm not sure I quite understand what you are saying here... if a doctrine is rooted in Biblical principles, would it not follow that the doctrine is there to help people live in imitation of Christ?<br><br><blockquote><font face="Comic Sans MS"> ‘I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone— for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.

If I may, I think the question is mostly about how one ensures one's continued salvation. I mostly agree with what you say, that we must follow God's commandments and follow Christ.<br><br>For me, anyway, the question is more about how we continue to be sure we are saved. As I have previously experienced it on the Protestant side, it is largely one-sided, because there is no physical manifestation or confirmation of God's forgiveness. It's kind of like sending out an email saying &quot;I am terribly sorry for what I did,&quot; and trusting that God received it, and accepted your request for forgiveness. In the Catholic Church, it is more like we call God directly (through a physical representation of Christ on earth, i.e., a priest in persona Christi), and he assures us we are forgiven, and what we can do to do penance.<br><br>I don't mean to speak for Ned, but that's what the question means to me.<br><br>That's why the sacraments are so powerful, because they give us a physical sign of something spiritual. It still takes faith, but it's a lot more tangible when you have something there physically to represent it.</span>

Slowly with no pressure we made our way through each one and by the end there had already been a shift.

The day after the healing session I continued to clean using Hoʻoponopono and also <em>The Work</em>.  That night I had a series of dreams that began with frustration and disturbing feelings.  Each of those dreams was cleaned and by morning, even though there was a line of memories waiting to be cleaned there was an obvious shift….
