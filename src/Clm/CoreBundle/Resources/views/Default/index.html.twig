<li>That infinite peace is available to you at any time, whenever you choose?</li>
<li>That you can stop suffering right now, forever?</li>
<li>That joy can be yours eternally?</li>
<li>That a life of inspiration can have you being fulfilled in all areas of life?</li>
<li>That your true essence is perfect Love?</li>
<li>That the potential to heal yourself and others is within you?</li>
<li>That you can have anything that you desire?</li>
<li>That you possess the inherent ability to use your intuition to know the best decisions to make?</li>
<li>That you have amazing abilities that you can easily learn to use?</li>
</ul>

<p>This might seem hard to believe right now, but throughout this site, we will show you all of this, and much more. We will teach you how to tap into all of these possibilities for yourself. Is it easy? Most definitely not! But it is very much within your reach.</p>

<p>You can be sure that your beliefs <em>will</em> be challenged. We try to include as many perspectives as possible, but once you decide to take the plunge into something deeper, your beliefs will begin to crumble. It is a wonderful process, however, for as your beliefs crumble, it leaves room for the Light of Truth to enter in. All beliefs crumble under the power of the Light of Christ, and they are replaced with infinite Love. There is nothing to fear. This is the way of spiritual growth.</p>
