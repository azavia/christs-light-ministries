There's been a lot going on.</p><p>Firstly, don't forget about our community center. This is a place for our visitors to get to know each other, share their successes, failures, frustrations, questions about their spiritual path, and even their personal stories that have made them who they are. This can be done in the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-forums.html">spiritual forums</a>.</p><p>The greatest benefit is that you don't even have to register. Just jump in and begin posting your ideas, opinions, and stories.</p><p>My biggest goal is to create what I call a virtual spiritual community. Of course nothing can replace face-to-face interaction among people who share similar beliefs, but to be able to open up to others who will encourage and support you instead of judge and condemn you can be so healing. We heavily moderate the posts to make sure that it remains an open, welcoming, supportive environment where people can open up and be themselves.</p><p>Of course, we can't have a community without people. Please share your story, your successes, your frustrations, your challenges, or just your opinions or beliefs. Why not post something after you read this newsletter?</p><p>Also in the community center, we've created a page for <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/contributors.html">our contributors</a>. Of course the first two are <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/christine.html">Christine</a> and <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/brandon.html">me</a>. Then, new to the site, but someone who's been with us in the past, is <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/okoit-b-etyang.html">Okoit B. Etyang</a>. He just recently posted <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/my-perspective.html">an introduction to himself</a> so that you can learn more about him.</p><p>On any of our profiles, you can see the pages we've written, and comment on our profiles to ask us questions or give your feedback.</p><p>And, if you want to be a contributor yourself to write on the topics you love, you can <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/contributors.html#INV">request to be a contributor</a> and create your profile page! You can even get your own blog page under <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-reflections.html">spiritual reflections</a> if you like.</p><p>We also added <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-reflections.html">spiritual reflections</a>. Here, Christine and I have posted our own personal spiritual reflections, ideas, and experiences, and you can even share your own. This is a place to freely post just about anything you like, as long as it is related to spirituality. Think of it kind of like a blog, except <em>you</em> can contribute your own posts, too!</p><p>One of the latest reflections is from Christine, where she writes about <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/recent-discoveries-about-my-faith.html">why she is exploring her faith</a>.</p><p>Speaking of exploring our faith, I just began posting a series of articles that is very close to my heart: <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/change-your-beliefs.html">Change Your Beliefs</a>.</p><p>Have you ever wondered whether your faith is really working for you? Is it making you more fulfilled, whole, happy, and joyous? Spirituality is supposed to return us to our natural state, which is pure joy and love.</p><p>This series of articles explores when and why you should change your beliefs, and how to go about the process in the best way. So far, I have posted <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/why-change-your-beliefs.html">Why Change Your Beliefs</a>, which discusses whether or not you should really change your beliefs, but I will be posting more soon.</p><p>This is so close to me because I changed my beliefs a lot growing up, and have witnessed Christine going through the same thing, as she discusses in her reflection. It can be an extremely lonely, fearful, frightening process. Everyone has an agenda: they either want you in this religion or that. I want to be an unbiased source to help people to discover what is best for themselves, and walk them through the process at their own pace.</p><p>The community comes through again here, though. If you have gone through this process of changing your beliefs, or even if your beliefs have just been challenged but you decided to stay where you are, it is valuable for people to hear about your experiences. So, you can <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/change-your-beliefs.html#INV">share your story</a>, and it will be published on the site.</p><p>Similarly, if you are going through the process, or even just thinking about it, the best way to get help, or to discuss your fears, is to <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/change-your-beliefs.html#INV">share with the rest of the community</a>, and we can support you and give you encouragement.</p><p>If you're interested in spiritual growth with the help of a guide to help you to overcome your past issues, resolve past karma, and avoid the pitfalls and temptations of the ego, <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-spiritual-counseling">schedule a session for spiritual counseling</a>. Even one session can help you to better discover your life purpose, where you have come from, even in past lives, and where you are going in the future.</p><p>If you need healing physically, emotionally, mentally, or spiritually, then read about <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/sgz-holistic-healing">holistic healing</a>. We work with the Holy Spirit to know what exactly is the best to do for you and how best to resolve and heal whatever needs to be healed.</p><p>Finally, for those who just simply need prayer, either for yourself or a loved one, please feel free to submit a <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/sgz-request-prayer">prayer request</a>, either publicly or privately. If it is public, then other visitors can pray for you and give you encouragement. If it is private, then Christine and I will pray for you, or optionally, we can call you to pray for you over the phone or Skype.</p><p>If you want to keep updated on all the new content on Christ's Light Ministries, don't forget to subscribe to the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-rss">RSS feed</a>.</p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="news">In the News</h2></p><p>So, if you were unfortunate enough not to be raptured over the weekend, you might be interested in my article on the matter: <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/so-were-you-raptured.html"><em>So, Were You Raptured?</em></a></p><p>It's hard to believe how much press this story got, for just being a little fringe group that was promoting it. Please comment on the above article and let me know what you think of the whole ordeal. Were you waiting around wondering if it would happen, or did you just go about your business?</p><p>I knew it wouldn't, but any time someone says it is the end of the world, I have to admit that just a small part of my mind wonders if it could happen. Of course, this guy's evidence was very, very weak, enough to be laughed at, but I still had to think.</p><p>I'll be much more interested to see what happens on December 21, 2012, but that won't be an ending as much as a shifting and transitioning.</p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="daily-inspiration">Daily Inspiration</h2></p><p>I've been restructuring the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/daily-inspiration.html"><strong>Daily Inspiration</strong></a>.

So many people have commented how much they love these messages, and how much they help them. Here is a list of last week's messages, with the link to each. Remember to <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-rss">subscribe to the RSS feed</a> to receive them every day.</p><p><h3>Jesus' Messages</h3><dl><dt><a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/jesus-message-63-may-22-2011.html"><b>Jesus' Message #63: May 22, 2011</b></a></dt><dd>Jesus' message says that we must discern His message, for there are many who preach messages of fear and guilt.

He says that the healing for all wounds is forgiveness.</dd></p><p></dl></p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="article">Article: What is the True Religion?</h2></p><p>In conjunction with the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/change-your-beliefs.html">Change Your Beliefs</a> pages, I want to discuss whether or not there is really one true spiritual path.</p><p>Now unfortunately, this is one of those subjects where I can really only share my personal opinion. There's no scientific proof that I can point to, or universal philosophical law that I can call upon. But perhaps, if you allow yourself to have an open mind, you can understand what I am saying.</p><p>I created Christ's Light Ministries with the belief that spirituality should lead us to true happiness, joy, harmony, and peace. If it does not, then something has gone wrong. Of course, there are assumptions there, but I feel quite confident about these assumptions.</p><p>I believe in God. Because I believe in God, I believe that He possesses all goodness. I believe that God loves us completely, unconditionally, and infinitely. There's no limit to God's love. See <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/god-loves-us.html">why God loves us</a> for more of an explanation on this.</p><p>If God loves us, he desires the best for us. That doesn't mean the best in the moment, in our limited finite picture, but the best for us overall. Even the Bible says that God works for good for those who love Him (Romans 8:28):</p><p><blockquote>And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.</blockquote></p><p>Above all, God desires a relationship with us. He desires that we love Him, and that we love others. This is the first step in our return to God.</p><p><h3>The Three Functions of God</h3></p><p>I've mentioned the three functions of God here and there, but never in great detail, and unfortunately I can't elaborate too much here, either. These functions were revealed to me by Jesus a few months ago, and since then it only makes more sense the more I explore.</p><p>There is the popular conception of the Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. I see these more as manifestations, functions, and qualities of God rather than necessarily persons that make up God, so to speak. These three functions and qualities are infinite and perfect.</p><p>The quality of the Father is Being, and His function is Truth. The Father possesses all Truth, because He <em>is</em>. When something exists, it is true in the most basic sense.</p><p>The quality of the Son is Knowledge, and His function is Power. This makes sense to me because God's knowledge is in that He knows Himself fully. When you know yourself fully, then you possess all power because there is nothing about yourself that is hidden.</p><p>The quality and function of the Holy Spirit is the same, and that is Love. This is why Jesus emphasizes love so much in <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/jesus-messages.html">His messages</a>, because it is the first step back to the Godhead. In order to even think about living a spiritual life, or progressing on the spiritual path, you <em>have</em> to love as God loves, or at least as close to that perfection as possible.</p><p><h3>Love is First</h3></p><p>Notice that in this progression, love is first, and truth is last. In most organized religions that emphasize that their religion is the only right way, truth comes first, and sometimes, sadly, love comes last. This inverts the order of spiritual growth.</p><p>It is like running a marathon before you are even crawling, when crawling is hard enough as it is. You try to run, and inevitably stumble because you haven't taken the necessary preliminary steps. So you stumble and fall, and then you blame yourself and feel guilty because you can't run, and your coach (church) says you are a sinner because you can't run.</p><p>Those who have true wisdom have realized that they first have to learn how to crawl, then how to walk, and finally they can consider the matter of running. Everyone else mocks them because they are doing something completely different, and they are labeled as bad or evil, but really they are taking the most logical path to success.</p><p>So, love comes first. For most people, love is quite hard enough. Very few people really love as they should, and even fewer love perfectly as God loves, though there are many who would like to point out that they do.</p><p>As you love, you learn to forgive. As you forgive, you learn to reconcile with yourself and with God. You learn more about yourself, which helps you to gain knowledge of yourself and of God, which gives you authority and power. Jesus has talked about this several times in His messages, too&mdash;stepping into your true and rightful authority.</p><p>As you do this, you begin to learn how to <em>be</em>. When you learn this, you finally begin to really know Truth.</p><p>Of course, all throughout the process, you learn more and more about truth. You learn a little more about how to love. As a result, you have more knowledge and power, and realize just a bit more of the truth. Each step influences all of the steps before it and after it.</p><p>If you knew the truth from the beginning, you would have nowhere to go. Jesus knew the full truth. Buddha knew the full truth. However, they taught how to <em>love</em>.</p><p>God is not looking for perfection. There is not a time, until perhaps the very end of your spiritual journey, where you love perfectly, have full knowledge and power, and possess all truth. God doesn't expect you to. Like I said, God is a God of relationships. He wants to have a relationship with you, and He will guide you into all truth. But first, He will teach you how to love.</p><p><h3>Why No Religion is the Truth</h3></p><p>Religion is just man's response to the unknown. Many of them have elements of the truth, but many of them also have elements of falsehood, fear, guilt, etc.</p><p>For example, you can see man's progression of their view of God in the Bible itself. The vision of God portrayed in the Old Testament is often so angry and jealous, even going so far as to war with and kill people. By the New Testament, we have learned that God is love. This marks a notable improvement in how man views God, but of course there are still limitations in that we still have a conception of eternal punishment.</p><p>This is the only explanation that makes sense for me for why God seems so different in the Old and New Testaments. It is not because God has changed, but because man has changed. Man has learned more about God and his relationship to God.</p><p>This is just as with you. You will change over time in your own view of God. God might be a bystander who doesn't really care about us. You might change to see God as an impersonal force who is in and through all things. Then you might see God as a personal being who takes interest in each of our individual lives. You might mix and match these, or have different views entirely. God has not changed; you have changed.</p><p>Have you ever met anyone who had all the answers? I haven't. So, why should you assume that a religion, which is made up of people, should have all the answers? So many religions have claimed exclusivity throughout history; what makes any certain one correct?</p><p><h3>Forge Your Own Path</h3></p><p>If you want to associate with a religion, that's great. Just realize that they don't have all the answers, just as you don't. It is best to learn your answers through God, listening to His silent inner voice in your heart, as Jesus has taught through His messages time and again. It's OK to have a community of believers to associate with; it can be uplifting for you. But be careful not to give them infallibility in your own spiritual path.</p><p>Start with <em>Love</em>. Love God; love your family; love your friends; love your enemies; love people you have never met in your life. Spread love throughout all the earth. This is the only sure way to spiritual growth, regardless of your beliefs about God, or complete lack of them. This is the surest way to a better life.</p><p>As you do this, you will be shown how to continue. As you love, the voice of God will become more audible to you. As you love, and listen to the voice of God, you will forgive others. As you forgive others, you will know yourself better, because the flaws you see in others are really sins you hold against yourself. As you know yourself better, you gain more power, because only those who love have true authority, for they share in God's power. As you gain in this sharing of God's power, you learn how to <em>be</em>, and to <em>be</em> is the end of all Truth.</p><p>If you want to work with someone on this path, <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-spiritual-counseling">spiritual counseling</a> can be a great option. We help people on all spiritual paths, and try to emphasize what all of these paths have in common. If you just need to remove some obstacles in your life, then try <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/sgz-holistic-healing">holistic healing</a>.</p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="practice">Practice: Loving All People</h2></p><p>If you aren't already working on hearing God's voice, <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/Spiritual_Growth_EZine-issue-1.html#practice">go back to the practice in issue 1</a>. This is vital in finding your way along the spiritual path. <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-journey.html#INV">Post in the forums if you are having difficulty.</a></p><p>There is a Buddhist meditation that focuses on having you love all people. This is an adaptation of that meditation.</p><p>Sit down quietly somewhere where you will not be disturbed. Get into a relaxed position, though perhaps not too relaxed so you don't fall to sleep.</p><p>Simply relax all of your muscles. Send a wave of relaxation all throughout your body, loosening any muscles that feel tight to you. Now close your eyes.</p><p>First imagine the people you love the most. These might be your partner, your family, or close friends. Send the greatest wave of love that you can muster through your heart to all of these people individually. See the love entering them and that person just brightens up. You wish them the best health, the best success, and the best life.</p><p>Now repeat this for people not so close. Perhaps distant members of your family, or mere acquaintances. People you care for, but who aren't really close to you. Again, send them all the love that you can, and wish them the best. See them brighten from your love.</p><p>Next, send love to people you are completely neutral about. Perhaps someone you met today that you don't know. Just call to mind random people that you don't really care either way about. But now, make yourself care. Love them just as you love your partner or your closest family and friends. See them brighten, and wish them the best health, the best success, and the best life. Wish them true happiness.</p><p>Now, think about your enemies. This is probably the hardest step. Call each of them to mind individually. See, perceive, and truly know the goodness that is within each of them. Send great waves of love to them, and see them brighten. Wish them the best health, the best success, and the best life. Wish them true happiness and peace.</p><p>Finally, see all the people of all the world, both good and bad. Encompass them all in your love, which comes from God. Send them a great wave of love, and see the whole world brighten.
