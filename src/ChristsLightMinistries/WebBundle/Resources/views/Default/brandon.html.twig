Rev. Brandon Olivares

<p>My name is Rev. Brandon A. Olivares, and I, along with <a  href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/christine.html">Christine</a> (my beautiful fiance), started Christ's Light Ministries. I am so passionate about spiritual growth and helping others to grow spiritually, as well as bringing healing to them.</p>

<p>I lost my sight at the age of four, as the result of a brain tumor. I was never bitter, but believed that I could overcome any obstacle, and wanted to live as normal of a life as possible. I have always had an inquisitive mind, and always wanted to find the truth for myself, which has lead me on a long, sometimes arduous journey in pursuit of that truth.</p>

<p>I have been sensitive from a young age. As long as I can remember, I have always been able to sense spirits when they are around me, as well as the energy of other people. I was heavily involved in the new-age off-and-on for ten years from the age of nine. This study of the new-age introduced me to energy healing, in which I became very interested. I also had the chance to develop my intuition, and focus on my ability to sense the energy of people and spirits around me. This ability has never left me, and in fact has only grown stronger with time.</p>

<p>In August of 2009, I met <a  href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/christine.html">Christine</a>, who is now my fianc&eacute; and future wife. She introduced me to the charismatic movement within the Catholic Church. Though it took me a while to get used to it, I soon had been blessed with many of the gifts of the Holy Spirit in January, 2010, including the gifts of healing, discernment of spirits (deliverance), prophecy, and tongues. Gradually, these gifts were unfolded more and more.</p>

<p>I had a period where I was interested in the Catholic Church, and so shut down many of these abilities that were so natural to me before. I became Catholic on April 3, 2010, but soon thereafter realized that I felt very restricted, and could not reach my full potential that way. Of course, I respect the Catholic Church and help people who are Catholic, but I realized that it just wasn't for me.</p>

<p>I soon became interested again in energy healing, by the encouragement of Christine. I soon decided that it was possible to integrate these alternative methods of healing I had before studied, including Reiki, with these other gifts of the Holy Spirit. In this way, I have seen much healing take place, which inspires me even more to continue. My gift of healing has only blossomed since then. I now try to reach as many people as possible, no matter what religion they are or spiritual tradition they adhere to, in order to bring healing to them, and allow them to find their purpose.</p>

On our spiritual journey, it can become evident that we need God's help&mdash;we need God's grace to get us through. Without it, we get hopelessly stuck in this world without a way out.<br><br>
So we must pray for and accept that grace. However, there are a few basic different types of grace: sanctifying grace and actual grace. Knowing the difference can help us even more to know what is happening supernaturally in our relationship with God, and motivate us to pursue spiritual growth with even more vigor.
