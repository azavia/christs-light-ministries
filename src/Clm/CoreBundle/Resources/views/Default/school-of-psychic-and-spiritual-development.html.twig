Want to Develop Your Psychic Abilities with a Spiritual Background?<br>
Join the <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong>!
</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">
By <a href="brandon.html">Rev. Brandon A. Olivares</a>
</p>

<p>There is a sense that is built into each one of us, without many of us even knowing about it. This sense can help you to know more about yourself, your own life, and the major questions you have. It can allow you to help others, to answer their own questions, or show you the best way you can help them. You can learn about how to develop this unknown sense with the <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong>.</p>

<p>Perhaps you already know about your intuitive sense, and you might already be using it to some extent. Maybe you want to learn how to develop it even more, even wanting to do readings for others, either friends and family, or even people you don't know. You may even want to create a business around your new skills, or integrate them into the work you're already doing, such as in counseling, life coaching, etc. The <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong> can help you no matter where you are in your psychic development.</p>

<h2>Why Should I Develop My Psychic Potential?</h2>

<p>Have no doubt, every person on earth has an intuition, and has psychic abilities latent within them. I guarantee that <em>you</em> do, too. But you might ask why you would be interested in developing them.</p>

<p>The truth is that these abilities are a sense that every person should have in full. However, it is like explaining to a blind person why they might want to accept the sense of sight and how that might change their world. The changes are just so overwhelming and all-pervasive that you just can't really explain it.</p>

<p>I'm left with much the same dilemma. When you have developed your psychic abilities, it is not only some strange new power that you suddenly possess, it is an entire new sense that gives you so much more information about yourself and the world around you that you could have <em>never</em> known before. It gives you just as much information, if not more, than a brand new sense, but I think that with enough practice, it can be just as accurate when used in the right ways.</p>

<p>But here are just a few of the many benefits to developing your psychic abilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Learn More About Yourself</h3>

<p>Sometimes we don't even know ourselves very well, or what our purpose is in this lifetime. When you develop your psychic abilities, you can quickly learn why you are here, where you are going, and how best you can get there. You can learn what lessons you are working out, which will give you greater insight into whatever situations you might be going through.</p>

<p>Of course you can always see someone, such as in <a href="spiritual-counseling.html">spiritual counseling</a>, to tell you these things, but then what about if you want to know more? Why go to someone else when you can develop this same sense yourself? As they say, if you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day, but if you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. The <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong> can teach you this essential skill.</p></li>

<li><h3>Get Advanced Warning</h3>

<p>Psychic development can help you to learn about things before anyone else does. Of course, these are only things that you have a right to know. There's no snooping or spying here. However, this can help you to know things far in advance, and prepare yourself, or respond so that it might not happen. You have to have the wisdom to know when you should try to change it, though, because sometimes you just can't, but at least you knew in advance. The <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong> will teach you how to be open to these warnings and how to respond.</p></li>

<li><h3>Learn More About Others</h3>

<p>As you develop your psychic abilities, you will begin to get information about people just as you meet them. This is information such as what kind of mood this person is in, whether they are overall positive or negative, and whether they are to be trusted. It can help you with business decisions, to know when a business opportunity just doesn't <em>feel</em> right. The <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong> will help you to trust your own feelings in these situations.</p></li>

<li><h3>Access Your Spiritual Guidance</h3>

<p>did you know that before you were born, you were assigned a group of spiritual guides from the other side? You can call them guardian angels, as you certainly have angels around you, or spirit guides, depending on what you are most comfortable with in your own belief system.</p>

<p>These spiritual guides aren't in physical form, so many people don't know how to talk to them. Often the most that anyone knows of them is when they hear an inner voice warn them of something when in a dire situation. It is easier for them to get across when you are hyper focused like that. However, what if you could talk to them at any moment? What could they share with you?</p>

<p>Well, they certainly won't make your decisions for you, but they can tell you the best course of action to take. They can help you if you only ask, and make things a lot easier for you. And, yes, the <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong> can help you to contact them, and even understand their response.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>OK, I Know All This Stuff! What About <em>Me</em>?</h2>

<p>The <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong> helps beginners who have never consciously used their intuition before, but it is so much more than that. I can teach you to improve your psychic abilities no matter if you are just starting, or if you have been at this for years and want to take it to the next level.</p>

<p>You might even want to learn to be a professional psychic reader. No problem; I'll coach you through the process of doing a professional psychic reading, and I'll even set you up with some test clients so you can go at it yourself with people you have never met before in your life! Now where can you find that?</p>

<p>If you're interested in creating your own business to do psychic readings or intuitive or spiritual counseling, or you want to integrate it into your existing work, I can give you advice on how to go about getting started. I can even help you to get started on the path to creating a successful, content-rich Web site to promote your work and get people to request psychic readings. Yes, all of this is covered in the <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong>.</p>

<h2>Why Should I Choose The <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong>?</h2>

<p>Listen, I searched the Web for any class or course that came anywhere close to what is being offered here. I found <em>nothing</em>. Everything that I found offered either e-books, audio courses, or personal seminars that ran in the thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>E-Books can serve as a great start, but there's no way that they can take you very far. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to developing your psychic abilities. Every person is unique, and has their own challenges and difficulties, and needs help unique to each situation. Many of these courses don't even allow you to ask questions.</p>

<p>Seminars are great, for those who can afford them. However, many people just don't have the disposable income or the <em>time</em> to attend such a seminar, and it can often be very intensive and overwhelming. Who can take off work for a week on a whim? Even if you can, it's easier just to do psychic development on the side, going at the pace that works for you.</p>

<p>So, what does the <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong> have over all of these other options?</p>

<h3>One-on-One Instruction over the Phone or Skype</h3>

<p>So, the <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong> is a middle-of-the-road solution. YOu can do it distantly, but you get to work with someone one-on-one to discuss and work through your specific challenges and answer all of your questions without you feeling like you are on the clock. In fact, you are able to directly talk to me, <a href="brandon.html">Rev. Brandon</a>.</p>

<p>You are guaranteed fifteen lessons on the phone with me, privately, working through your questions and challenges, and teaching you even more on how to develop your psychic abilities. Yes, that's right, these hour lessons are not shared with any other student; it is just <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>The frequency of the lessons is completely up to you and your progress. It can take anywhere from seven to fifteen weeks.</p>

<h3>Priority Scheduling for Urgent Questions or Challenges</h3>

<p>In addition to that, if you ever have any urgent questions or challenges, you can schedule a time with me to talk over the phone, and you get priority scheduling so that we can talk as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Exclusive One-Year Access to Our Weekly Psychic Development Phone Conference</h3>

<p>Every student is guaranteed one-year access to our exclusive weekly conference call on psychic and spiritual development. Every week, you can join in as I teach about more specific topics on psychic and spiritual development that I just don't have enough time to discuss in the training. You can share your own experiences, and listen to other students as they share their experiences as well. Finally, you can ask your questions that you don't mind sharing with the group, and we can discuss and try to resolve them. Even better, if you can't join in some weeks, you always have access to the recorded transcript of the conference, so you can still benefit from the content.</p>

<p>Yes, that is 52 hours of specific, exclusive teachings on psychic development. This alone is worth the price of the school. You can even renew your access for another year if you like, for a reduced price.</p>

<h3>Exclusive Lifetime Access to the <strong>Psychic and Spiritual Development Newsletter</strong></h3>

<p>Get exclusive access to our <strong>Psychic and Spiritual Development Newsletter</strong>. Even more exclusive material on psychic development is shared in these newsletters, and you can also read about experiences that our students have shared. You have access to this newsletter for life.</p>

<h3>Chakra Balancing and Alignment</h3>

<p>At the beginning of each level (every five lessons), you will receive a full chakra balancing. This will serve to realign and open the chakras, open up the energy pathways in your body and soul, clear out any residual karmic bonds, and open the third eye center and crown, which are the most important centers for psychic development. Also, as with all attunements that we do, we will pray for an infusion of God's Spirit, the Holy Spirit, to propel you forward both in your spiritual growth as well as your psychic development. The more open you are to this, the more that you will be transformed to be more open to psychic and spiritual development.</p>

<h3>Guided Meditations</h3>

<p>When you register for the <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong>, you will get free access to many of the guided meditations that we offer. Currently, this includes:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<a href="higher-self-guided-meditation.html">
<strong>Higher Self Guided Meditation</strong>
</a>
</dt>
<dd>
This is a guided meditation to help you to meet with and talk to your higher self, in order to gain more insight on your life purpose and what lessons you are here to learn. This guided meditation will supplement the specific training you will receive for communicating with your higher self, and give you a specific method for meeting with and talking to him or her through this meditation.

<h2>What Does Spiritual Development Have to Do with Psychic Development?</h2>

<p><em>Everything</em>!</p>

<p>When I did my research on other related courses, the one thing that struck me and saddened me was how it was marketed. I will never promise you strange new powers that you can influence others with or get your way. I will never tell you that you can get information about people that you have no right to. All of this is just an ego trip, and is sure to get you in trouble. If you are looking for that, you are in the wrong place.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that psychic abilities should be developed hand-in-hand with your spiritual growth. It doesn't matter to me what religion you are, or if you just have personal spiritual beliefs, but you need some sort of spirituality to serve as a worthy foundation of these new psychic abilities. If you don't have that foundation, you have the risk of being overcome, using them for the wrong reasons, and even being influenced by negative forces. All of that is very ugly, and we won't go anywhere near it.</p>

<p>Yes, psychic abilities can be developed without spirituality, but they can be developed even more powerfully when you are becoming more spiritually advanced. It is like rowing a boat against the current of the river vs. along with the current. If you try to develop psychic abilities on their own, you are rowing against the current, and may even get caught in some rapids or get bashed against some rocks. Ouch! However, if you work on your spiritual development as well, then you are going with the flow of the river, and you will reach your destination even faster.</p>

<p>There are powers in the universe that you could not even dream of. However, I guarantee you that these powers are yours if you become spiritually developed. God only gives such powers to those who are highly spiritually developed, because they are the only ones who know how to use them responsibly. If your only concern is for power, then they will work against you.</p>

<p>So, this school is rather different from any other because it integrates spirituality in the teaching of psychic development. If you trust me in this, you will see much more than you ever thought possible, if you promise only to use it for the good.</p>

<h2>Take Your First Step to Psychic Mastery Today</h2>

<p>So, just to summarize, when you sign up for the <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong>, you get:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fifteen hours of private, one-on-one lessons with me, <a href="brandon.html">Rev. Brandon Olivares</a> over the phone or Skype</li>
<li>Priority scheduling to talk to me about urgent questions or challenges</li>
<li>Exclusive access to the psychic development weekly conference for up to one year, with the option to renew</li>
<li>Access to recordings from the exclusive psychic development weekly conference for up to one year</li>
<li>Exclusive lifetime access to the <strong>Psychic and Spiritual Development Newsletter</strong> for even more teachings not found in the lessons</li>
<li>Three full sessions of chakra balancing to open up your energy pathways, activate the third eye psychic center, and pray for an infusion of the Holy Spirit for accelerated growth.</li>
</ul>

<p>What will you learn in the lessons? Because every person is different, they are customized to each student, but you can expect to learn this, and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to begin to listen to and trust your intuition</li>
<li><strong>Important!</strong> How to protect yourself from negative energy and spirits</li>
<li>How to read your own energy centers, called chakras, and the flow of energy in your body and soul</li>
<li>How to communicate with your angels and spirit guides. If your belief system only recognizes angels, that is fine, too.</li>
<li>How to read the energy field of another person to get quick information about them</li>
<li>The ethics of reading other people</li>
<li>How to discover your own life lessons and life purpose</li>
<li>How to get information about yourself, any situation, or any person (that you have the right to know about) in the past, present, and future</li>
<li>How to scan the chakras and energy flow of another person for even deeper information</li>
<li>How to scan the timeline for yourself or any person</li>
<li>How to do psychic defense and psychic battle and free people of negative forces, evil spirits, and demons</li>
<li>How to conduct a professional reading for a client</li>
<li>How to create a business around psychic or intuitive readings, or how to integrate it into your own work</li>
<li>How to create a successful, profitable Web site for doing readings</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Do I Get Started?</h2>

<p>The <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong> is split into three levels. Each level gets more advanced than the last.</p>

<p>You are not required to do all three levels, but it is highly encouraged. Each level will give you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Five lessons of psychic and spiritual development</li>
<li>One attunement and chakra balancing</li>
<li>Four months access to the exclusive psychic development weekly conference. All three levels will give you a full year's access.</li>
<li>Lifetime access to the <strong>Psychic and Spiritual Development Newsletter</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I strongly encourage you to start with the first level, no matter how experienced you might be in psychic development. Each lesson is customized for each individual student, and there is more than enough material that we can go over that you probably have not learned before, or I can help you to master things you have had trouble with in the past. If you really think you should start with a later level, <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> and I will evaluate your request.</p>

<p>Read through all of the below options before choosing. You can purchase any level by itself, but there are discounts for purchasing two or all three levels together.</p>

<p><strong>Important!</strong> Just for a limited time, the next ten people who sign up for the <strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong> will receive a 20% discount! Be sure to get in now to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>

<h3>Our Guarantee</h3>

<p>I know it can be difficult to decide. I guarantee you that if you try out this program, and are not satisfied within the first 30 days, you will get your full money back.</p>

        <h3>Featured Testimonial</h3>
        <p>I had a holistic healing session with <a  href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/brandon.html">Brandon</a> over Skype two nights ago.  We spent some time talking and began going over the questions I had answered on his <a href="http://holistic-healing.christs-light-ministries.org/intake-form.php" onClick="window.location.href='http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/cgi-bin/counter.pl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fholistic-healing%2Echrists-light-ministries%2Eorg%2Fintake-form%2Ephp&referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Echrists-light-ministries%2Eorg%2Fschool-of-psychic-and-spiritual-development%2Ehtml'; return false;">form</a>.  Slowly with no pressure we made our way through each one and by the end there had already been a shift.  But the healing did not end there.</p>
<p>A large focus of the healing is about a shift from living in "ought" or "obligation" to living in "inspiration". The day after the healing session I continued to clean using HoÊ»oponopono and also <em>The Work</em>.  That night I had a series of dreams that began with frustration and disturbing feelings.  Each of those dreams was cleaned and by morning, even though there was a line of memories waiting to be cleaned there was an obvious shiftâ€¦.
