<p>Why would you want to change your beliefs? Many people grow up in the religion of their parents. As they get older, they begin to question the doctrines that they were taught as children. They begin to have the desire to explore other belief systems and spiritual paths. is this you?</p>

<p>Perhaps you have come to realize, or at least to suspect, that things just aren't working for you anymore. Your religion isn't bringing the fulfillment that it promised. People say that you just have to bear with it and suffer, but you aren't satisfied with that answer. This may be a cause to change your beliefs as well.</p>

<p>No matter how you have come to this point, if you are reading this, you are probably at the point where your religion or spiritual path just isn't doing anything for you. When you are faced with this situation, you have two possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change your beliefs: you can explore different religious or spiritual traditions, and find one that fulfills you and inspires you more than your current belief system, or</li>
<li>Stay where you are: you can allow your current spiritual path to revive you into renewed interest and fervor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether to change your beliefs is something that should be considered carefully, but I will try to help you to make this all-important decision here.</p>

<h2>Why I Changed My Beliefs</h2>

<p>Up until I was about nine years old, the question of what religion I was was meaningless, because Christian was all there was, in my view. I hadn't heard of anything else. I remember a funny little conversation between a few of my friends and me when I was in first grade. Someone asked me what religion I was, and I was confused by the question. All I could answer with was "Christian." What else could there be?</p>

<p>Then my older cousin introduced me to Wicca. She had been studying it for a while, and told me about her beliefs, and about some of the things she had found out about Christianity. These were things that are common knowledge to me and many people now, but I didn't know this at the time, so it was quite shocking. These were things such as: Jesus wasn't actually born on December 25, and that many of the Christian holidays had Pagan origins.</p>

<p>This was rather revolutionary for me, because I hadn't even thought of exploring my beliefs before this. Of course I already had a great interest in God, but that what I believed might not be true was a novel thought. Luckily, I wasn't too deeply rooted in my previous beliefs, so the transition wasn't too difficult for me, but I know that for many, it is.</p>

<p>My young mind adapted well to thinking that something else might be true, and I jumped into it with full force. I didn't even give it a second thought. Of course, seeing as at that time, we didn't go to church anymore, and my own family wasn't very religious, I didn't really <em>have</em> to give it much thought. With the Internet at my fingertips, I could find more than enough to learn about other belief systems. Wicca was my first target, but far from my last.</p>

<p>So, why did I change my beliefs? Honestly, there was no reason <em>not</em> to at that time. I wasn't receiving any religious instruction from my own family, and if there was even a remote chance that what I was taught growing up wasn't true, I wanted to know, and i wanted to learn what <em>was</em> true, plain and simple.</p>

<p>However, that simple decision kickstarted my spiritual path, and I was so much happier and more fulfilled as a result. My spirituality after that point got me through my very challenging teenage years, even though it was the very thing that got me a lot of flak at school.</p>

<p>So, if you just aren't very dedicated to your current belief system or have no personal interest in it, you are free to change your beliefs as you will, and in fact I would encourage it. Why stick with what you grew up in if you have no vested interest in it? Explore, and expand your horizons.</p>

<h2>Why Christine Changed Her Beliefs</h2>

<p>Let's take <a  href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/christine.html">Christine's</a> story for another case, that is probably more similar to most people reading here.</p>

<p>Christine grew up Catholic; there's no doubt about that. Her family was just about as Catholic as they come. She was introduced into the charismatic movement, loved being prayed over, went to Mass every week, and the whole nine yards.</p>

<p>She came to <a href="http://www.franciscan.edu/" target="_blank" onClick="window.open('http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/cgi-bin/counter.pl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Efranciscan%2Eedu%2F&referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Echrists-light-ministries%2Eorg%2Fwhy-change-your-beliefs%2Ehtml'); return false;">Franciscan University of Steubenville</a>, and a year later she met me.</p>

<p>I was in my Catholic phase back then, so everything was fine for a while. She was even my sponsor for <acronym title="Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults">RCIA</acronym>, which was a really good move for both of us, since it helped us to grow a lot closer, and it wasn't long after my confirmation that we got engaged.</p>

<p>Of course, I, Mr. Truth Seeker himself, quickly discovered that the Catholic Church was not at all the place for me. To my sensibilities, it seemed stuffy, confining, restrictive, and oppressive. No offense to Catholics who are reading; I acknowledge that it works for other people, just not me.</p>

<p>Now to poor Christine, this sudden change was quite unexpected. I think that she knew subconsciously that it was coming. She said that ever since she knew my faith journey, and that I had once been in the new-age, she was both fascinated and a bit scared, because she thought that I might very well go back to it. And back to it I did go.</p>

<p>The point is, it disrupted her beliefs rather badly. When you grow up thinking that your way of believing is the only right way, and that everyone else's is wrong, then you might be disoriented when you see that people are holding those &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; beliefs, and living quite happy lives independent of your own religion. That's not an easy thing to admit, and I give Christine all the credit for being able to admit that to herself.</p>

<p>In the end, she changed her beliefs not necessarily so easily as I did, but because she could see no alternative, and was forced through her own experiences to admit that truth was a lot broader than she was taught to believe. Yes, there were times where she would have rather stuck her head in the sand and pretended none of it was real, but in the end she knew that she had to admit that it was, and that it was effective.</p>

<p>We ended up in much the same place, though I have more of a new age slant, and Christine has more of a Christian slant. Now she feels free to explore her beliefs though, including other churches, which is the most important thing.</p>

<p>If you are like Christine, reality might have shown you a very different picture than your religion or spiritual path taught. You may see many different things than you ever thought possible. If this is the case, you may want to change your beliefs just to expand your own perspective to allow room for these new experiences. In Christine's case, there was no denying that they were real.</p>

<h2>Some Points to Consider When Deciding Whether to Change Your Beliefs</h2>

<p>So should you change your beliefs? It really depends, but here are some points you might want to consider:</p>

<ol>
<li><h3>Are Your Beliefs Consistent with Reality?</h3>

<p>Do your beliefs match up with reality? If they do not, then you might have bigger problems on your hands. Beliefs that are inconsistent in one area are usually inconsistent or even dangerous in others.</p>

<p>For instance, if your belief system insists that the earth is flat and chooses to ignore all scientific data to the contrary, then it is inconsistent with reality, and is therefore unreasonable.</p>

<p>A very good example is found in the Jehovah's Witnesses. Their organization made several predictions about when armageddon would strike, ever since the late 1800s. Obviously, they were very wrong every one of those times. One of the ways I came to realize that they were wrong is by the simple logic that if they were wrong so many times on the end of the world, then obviously something was wrong with their connection with God, so what other information might be called into question? Dedicated though they were, their results just didn't pan out.</p>

<p>If you are seeing inconsistencies in your beliefs, it points out a deeper issue, and you may definitely want to change your beliefs to correct those inconsistencies. Truth does not conflict with itself.</p>
</li>

<li><h3>Do Your Beliefs Make You Happy?</h3>

<p>How do you feel when you believe what you have been taught? Does it inspire or depress you? Do you feel joyful or fearful? If your beliefs cause you to live in shame, guilt, apathy, depression, fear, or anger, then something is wrong.</p>

<p>For example, there was a time when I was studying a lot of science, and so my mind was becoming more scientific. As this happened, I found that gradually, inevitably, my own faith in God was waning. God seemed improbable, if not impossible. However, during those few short months when I lost my faith, I was more unhappy and fearful than I had ever been. I regularly panicked at the thought of death being the end of it all. There was no more inspiration&mdash;what was the point?</p>

<p>I know that many arguments can be raised against this. First is that there are many atheists out there living happy, fulfilling lives, without such fear. And for them, that is great; maybe this belief system is right for them for now. But I don't know too many people who relish the idea of poofing out of existence after they die. If you do, that's good for you, but it certainly didn't work for me.</p>

<p>The other argument is that there is no guarantee that reality is essentially <em>good</em>, so it doesn't suggest anything at all if your belief system leaves you feeling empty. While I'm not about to get into a philosophical argument, those who have the sense to perceive, know that there is an underlying sense that goodness must prevail, and reality must be essentially ordered. It can't be proven scientifically, but it's just a basic intuition that we have as human beings. I will leave it at that.</p>

<p>But even beyond that, would you rather believe in something that leaves you feeling empty, or something that inspires you to live a better, more fulfilling life? I would rather believe in the latter. You can choose.</p>

<p>If your beliefs do not make you happy, but instead promote fear and guilt, this is a good indication to change your beliefs. Truth does not rely on fear or guilt.</p>
</li>

<li><h3>Do Your Beliefs Make You a Better Person?</h3>

<p>If everyone were to adopt your spiritual path, would the world be a better or a worse place?</p>

<p>This is important to know. Just as there is a general intuitive sense that our beliefs should leave us feeling better and more inspired, there is also an intuitive sense that our beliefs should make us live better, more moral lives, treating others with more respect and love.</p>

<p>For instance, Satanism is probably the utmost in self-centeredness. I once chatted with a Satanist, and her aura was so poisonous that I eventually had to cut off contact because of how it would affect me. These people's very energy fields seclude them from the rest, because they are focused on themselves.</p>

<p>How does your belief system make you act? Do you treat people with respect and love? Do you live out the golden rule? Do you regularly try to help others generously?</p>

<p>If you don't, it might not necessarily be because of your spiritual path. Human nature is human nature, and some people just aren't transformed by their beliefs to the extent that it really has an impact on their moral life. Rededicating yourself to your own spiritual path might be all you need to revitalize your life. Still, though, if every person in the world were a perfect follower of your religion, would the world be better off? Think long and hard about this one.</p>

<p>When you follow your spiritual path, it should bear good fruits. You should become a better person&mdash;more loving, compassionate, and caring. If not, you may want to change your beliefs to something that is more transforming for you.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not saying that every time you are unhappy with your own spirituality, you should go looking for another religion and change your beliefs. Some Christians have trouble with this, where every time they meet something that they disagree with in their church, they go church hopping. It's important to be committed and disciplined within your spiritual path.</p>

<p>However, if your own spiritual path truly makes you feel spiritually dead, uninspired, and you have already tried to rededicate yourself to that belief system, then it might be a good idea to get out, change your beliefs, and try something else.</p>

<h2>Is It OK to Change Your Beliefs?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, many people are afraid to change. They believe that to change belief systems is to betray God, or to betray their religion.</p>

<p>The truth is, God is God of all. No matter if you are Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, new age, occultist, or anything else, God is the same. The only thing that is different is your image of God.</p>

<p>If God is good, and God is loving, he would <em>want</em> you to explore, and to find the truth for yourself. He does not want blind followers who do not think for themselves; he gave you an intellect and free will, after all. Use those to your advantage, and there is nothing wrong with it if you change your beliefs.</p>

<p>When you explore other belief systems, it doesn't mean that you have to commit yourself to them. You can just as easily study some other spiritual paths, learn about each one to broaden your own perspective and deepen your experience, then return to your own all the wiser for the journey. You are not making a commitment to leave your religion when you decide to explore. If you decide to leave, that will come much later.</p>

<p>Be gentle with yourself. If you don't know anyone who you know without a doubt would support you, you don't even have to tell anyone yet. Just explore in your free time, and see what else is out there. Maybe go to a different church now and again, or study up on the beliefs of a certain religion. There is no obligation.</p>

<p>Most of all, this series of articles is for the purpose of helping you along that journey. It can be a confusing, sometimes frightening process, and I want to try to remove as much of that confusion and fear as possible.</p>

<p>If you have decided to begin this journey to possibly change your beliefs, or if you have questions about it, please <a href="change-your-beliefs.html#INV">share your story or questions</a>. There are many people who are in your shoes, or were once where you are, and can help you through the process and encourage you.</p>

<p>If you want to work one-on-one to assist you through this process to decide whether you want to change your beliefs, explore other spiritual paths, or stick where you are, you might be interested in <a  href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-counseling.html">spiritual counseling</a>. Our aim is to work with people of all spiritual paths, and we can help you to realize whether it might be best to explore other belief systems, or perhaps deepen your relationship with your own faith. You don't have to worry about us pushing you in any one direction; it is completely safe. It matters not to us whether you change your beliefs&mdash;only that you are happy with your spiritual path, and that you live a fulfilling life dedicated to God.</p>

        <h3>Featured Testimonial</h3>
        <p>I had a holistic healing session with <a  href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/brandon.html">Brandon</a> over Skype two nights ago.  We spent some time talking and began going over the questions I had answered on his <a href="http://holistic-healing.christs-light-ministries.org/intake-form.php" onClick="window.location.href='http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/cgi-bin/counter.pl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fholistic-healing%2Echrists-light-ministries%2Eorg%2Fintake-form%2Ephp&referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Echrists-light-ministries%2Eorg%2Fwhy-change-your-beliefs%2Ehtml'; return false;">form</a>.  Slowly with no pressure we made our way through each one and by the end there had already been a shift.  But the healing did not end there.</p>
<p>A large focus of the healing is about a shift from living in "ought" or "obligation" to living in "inspiration". The day after the healing session I continued to clean using HoÊ»oponopono and also <em>The Work</em>.  That night I had a series of dreams that began with frustration and disturbing feelings.  Each of those dreams was cleaned and by morning, even though there was a line of memories waiting to be cleaned there was an obvious shiftâ€¦.
