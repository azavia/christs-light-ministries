Traffic has exploded, all because we built it using the services and processes of <a href="http://buildit.sitesell.com/azavia.html">Site Build It!</a>. It's taught me more about building a successful Web site than I could have ever learned by myself, and it's already paying off in the first month. We got over 10,000 page views in May, and my goal is 20,000 for the month of June, and we are already well on the way to that goal, if not exceeding it.</p><p>One of the largest changes was the introduction of our two online schools. See the online schools section under the navigation bar on the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/">home page</a>.</p><p>First is the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/school-of-psychic-and-spiritual-development.html"><strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong></a>. This is an online course that lasts for 15 weeks, and includes one-on-one direction for developing your psychic abilities with a spiritual background. If you ever wanted to take your intuition to the next level, or even to become a professional intuitive, this is the way to do it! I will help you to get from wherever you are in your psychic development right now to become an experienced intuitive, even doing professional readings if that is your desire. I can help you to learn how to do professional readings, and how to create a business around that work, or integrate it into your existing work.</p><p>I'm offering a 20% discount to the first ten people to apply, so make sure you apply soon. We have already received a lot of interest, so I am sure that there will be a lot of competition for these ten spots.</p><p>Secondly, we have the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/school-of-the-healing-light-of-christ.html"><strong>School of the Healing Light of Christ</strong></a>. This is a school about learning to do holistic healing using the healing light of Christ. This requires no specific spiritual path; it matters not whether you are religious or merely on your own individual spiritual path.</p><p>It works very similarly to the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/school-of-psychic-and-spiritual-development.html"><strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong></a>. It consists in 15 lessons of personal instruction, as well as a lot of other extras that you can read about on the page. And, just as with the other school, the first ten people will get 20% off of the purchase price.</p><p>I've felt for a long time now that I am to share my knowledge and experience with others, and I feel that this is the perfect way to do it. I'm truly excited to work with those who would become students of these schools.</p><p>I'm also excited about our new section, <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/guided-meditations.html"><strong>Guided Meditations</strong></a>. I recently had the idea to develop a guided meditation, and so I sat down and did just that, developing the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/higher-self-guided-meditation.html"><strong>Higher Self Guided Meditation</strong></a>. In this meditation, you can learn to communicate with your higher self, to receive answers on your most pressing questions about life, your purpose here, the lessons you are to learn, and what is coming up for you in the future, whether they be challenges, obstacles, or victories. I had a great time developing this guided meditation, and I've already received good feedback on it, so I hope that it is helpful for you, too.</p><p>Oh, and, to the students of the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/school-of-psychic-and-spiritual-development.html"><strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong></a>, this and future meditations on psychic development will be offered for free to complement the training.</p><p>Don't forget about our community center. This is a place for our visitors to get to know each other, share their successes, failures, frustrations, questions about their spiritual path, and even their personal stories that have made them who they are. This can be done in the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-forums.html">spiritual forums</a>.</p><p>The greatest benefit is that you don't even have to register. Just jump in and begin posting your ideas, opinions, and stories.</p><p>My biggest goal is to create what I call a <em>virtual spiritual community</em>. Of course nothing can replace face-to-face interaction among people who share similar beliefs, but to be able to open up to others who will encourage and support you instead of judge and condemn you can be so healing. We heavily moderate the posts to make sure that it remains an open, welcoming, supportive environment where people can open up and be themselves.</p><p>Of course, we can't have a community without people. Please share your story, your successes, your frustrations, your challenges, or just your opinions or beliefs. Why not post something after you read this newsletter?</p><p>Do you want to write about your passion? If so, you can <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/contributors.html#INV">request to be a contributor</a> and create your profile page! You can even get your own blog page under <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-reflections.html">spiritual reflections</a> if you like.</p><p>We also added <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-reflections.html">spiritual reflections</a>. Here, Christine and I have posted our own personal spiritual reflections, ideas, and experiences, and you can even share your own. This is a place to freely post just about anything you like, as long as it is related to spirituality. Think of it kind of like a blog, except <em>you</em> can contribute your own posts, too!</p><p>My latest blog post was on <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/experimentation-with-energetic-vibrations.html">a recent experience I had with energetic vibrations</a>. I enjoy just writing about the spiritual experiences I have, and others seem to appreciate it, too, from the comments I have received.</p><p>If you're interested in spiritual growth with the help of a guide to help you to overcome your past issues, resolve past karma, and avoid the pitfalls and temptations of the ego, <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-spiritual-counseling">schedule a session for spiritual counseling</a>. Even one session can help you to better discover your life purpose, where you have come from, even in past lives, and where you are going in the future.</p><p>If you need healing physically, emotionally, mentally, or spiritually, then read about <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/sgz-holistic-healing">holistic healing</a>. We work with the Holy Spirit to know what exactly is the best to do for you and how best to resolve and heal whatever needs to be healed.</p><p>Finally, for those who just simply need prayer, either for yourself or a loved one, please feel free to submit a <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/sgz-request-prayer">prayer request</a>, either publicly or privately. If it is public, then other visitors can pray for you and give you encouragement. If it is private, then Christine and I will pray for you, or optionally, we can call you to pray for you over the phone or Skype.</p><p>If you want to keep updated on all the new content on Christ's Light Ministries, don't forget to subscribe to the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-rss">RSS feed</a>.</p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="daily-inspiration">Daily Inspiration</h2></p><p>What is the daily inspiration?

To some, it seems to come naturally, and others don't seem to have any intuitive sense at all. Is there any hope for those in the second category? Even if you already have some intuitive sense, can you develop your intuition even further?</p><p>No matter if you already have some intuitive sense or not, it is something that is latent in every individual, able to be developed. The trick is in determining how you best access intuitive information, which is something that I teach in the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/school-of-psychic-and-spiritual-development.html"><strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong></a>, but I'll outline some of the basics of accessing your intuition in this and future articles.</p><p><h3>Trust Your Intuition</h3></p><p>One of the most important things to consider when developing your intuition is to trust yourself. When you are in the first stages of developing your intuition, it can seem very inaccurate, because it's a new sense that you aren't used to yet. It is as though you were blind, and just learning to see again. At first, you won't be able to see things clearly, but might only be able to make out outlines. However, the more you practice, the clearer that your sight gets, until you are able to see things as clearly as anyone else.</p><p>So as with intuition. At first, it might seem that you are wrong a lot. You might question and second-guess your results, and get discouraged. However, if you stick it out and keep trying, it will become just as accurate as any of your other senses, when use properly. You should be able to rely on your intuition just like you rely on your sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. It is inherent in your very nature, so have no doubt that it is in your ability to develop.</p><p>That's one of the reasons that the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/school-of-psychic-and-spiritual-development.html"><strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong></a> lasts for 15 weeks, because it <em>is</em> a process that takes time, and you have to be patient with it and stick it out. If you give up too early, then your psychic sense is only half-developed, only working half the time, and the other half it produces inaccurate results. This is not a fault of the sense itself, just as one does not say that sight just doesn't exist if you can't see perfectly, or not see at all. No, you must give it all or nothing, or else you may as well not have it at all.</p><p>So what is the key component of developing your intuition? Trusting your results. When you consult your intuition, usually the first response, the one that comes up before you get the chance to think about it and analyze the answer, is the correct one. Begin to develop the habit of observing your mind, your feelings, and your emotions for the first response that arises from your intuition, and cut off the process of reanalyzing from the roots. When you do this, then your intuition will be able to communicate with you without your mind interjecting itself and interfering with the results.</p><p><h3>Types of Intuition</h3></p><p>You may not know this, but there are several types of intuitive sense, just as there are several physical senses. Just as with the physical senses, one of these spiritual senses may be, and usually is, stronger than the others. If you try to develop an intuitive sense that is not natural to you, this may be another reason that you get frustrated and give up. It is important that you find your preferred intuitive modality and use it appropriately. I will introduce these forms next week and begin to discuss them.</p><p>Until then, you can begin to explore your own intuitive sense through our <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/higher-self-guided-meditation.html"><strong>Higher Self Guided Meditation</strong></a>, which helps you to contact and communicate with your higher self in order to learn more about your life purpose and gain information much as you would through your intuition. All of these things interweave and overlap. It is very much worth the effort to do this guided meditation to begin to develop your ability to speak with your higher self, which will help with the development of your intuition.</p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="practice">Practice: Developing Your Intuition</h2></p><p>In beginning these practices, I will assume that you have not yet done much work with your intuition. If you have done so, you can still get much out of these practices.</p><p>To begin to develop your intuition, you have to relax; you have to become like a little child, seeing everything as magical and mysterious. You have to read between the lines of life, seeing the synchronicities that God has brought together for you. Remember, there is no such thing as a coincidence.</p><p>The best way to begin to develop your intuition is by merely setting the intent. I have noticed that when I've set the intention to do something, no matter what it is, I often soon have resources coming into my life to help me with that. After you set this intention, you might notice that you get intuitive flashes a lot more often, or maybe you just notice them more. Pay attention to these flashes, and even record down the results if you want. It is all about just playing around with it and not taking yourself too seriously.</p><p>Besides this, you can help the process along by intentionally trying to use your intuition. If someone calls, try to see if you can guess who it is before you answer. This might seem trivial, but it's easiest to start with trivial things before moving to more serious things.</p><p>Test your intuition by asking simple questions that can be verified soon thereafter. It might be easiest to start with simple yes or no questions. Ask yourself a simple question, and then see what you feel. It might come as a feeling you have in the pit of your stomach. It might be a thought that pops in your head. It might be an image that arises in your mind. It might be a word or phrase that you hear in your mind. Pay attention to how it arises, and whether the answer seems positive or negative. A positive answer would mean yes, and a negative answer would mean no. Then test it. If you get it right, congratulate yourself. If you get it wrong, do not be discouraged, but just try again the next time, perhaps noting down what about your method didn't work.</p><p>There is really no specific method to doing this. It is just about setting your intention and trying to practice your new intuitive sense. With time, you will get it. If you know about energy work or chakras, it may help to open up your chakras; that's another service that we offer in the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/school-of-psychic-and-spiritual-development.html"><strong>School of Psychic and Spiritual Development</strong></a>, that helps to really activate your intuition.</p><p>Until next time, simply practice. Feel free to ask questions in the <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spiritual-forums.html">spiritual forums</a>, or discuss your experiences so that others can be encouraged as well.</p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="donate">Support Our Cause</h2></p><p>Christ's Light Ministries is a simple site with simple beginnings, but with a big mission.
