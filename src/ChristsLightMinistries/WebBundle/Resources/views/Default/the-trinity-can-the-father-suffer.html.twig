But if we are speaking literally, exactly, NO, it is not possible for the Father to suffer and weep.<br><br>The Blessing of the Trinity be poured upon us all!<br>The following statements are totally true &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Any form of suffering necessarily means change.<br><br>The Person of the Father cannot change, cannot suffer.<br><br>The Person of the Holy Spirit cannot change, cannot suffer.<br><br>The Person of the Son CONSIDERED AS IDENTICAL WITH THE DIVINE NATURE and <i>NOT</i> IN HIS HUMAN NATURE cannot change.<br><br>The human nature of Jesus Christ CAN change, can and did suffer and die and rose from the dead.<br><br>The Second Divine Person CAN SUFFER AND DIE <i>IN HIS HUMAN NATURE ONLY</i> .. and, understanding that .. it is proper to say that the Second Divine Person, GOD, Suffered and Died (in His human nature).<br><br>The truths stated above involve what is known as &quot;Communicatio Idiomatum,&quot; or &quot;the Communication of Idioms.&quot;<br><br>Blessed be the Most Holy Trinity .. and thanks be to God we have received God's Revelation!

        June 20, 2009<br><br>JMJ / MMM     090620  Sunday<br>Hello Ned --<br>You wrote, “<font color="Blue">It is in that statement I AM that I station my faith. That may all sound very Buddhist, except that my experience has shown me that this I AM is a creative living Being and not a dead concept.It is loving because it begets all things. It is intelligent because all knowledge proceeds from it.</font>”<br><br>My first remark -- In my reading I’ve encountered some Buddhists, not Theravada but Mayahana, not many but a few, who seem to have “touched” God.  There’s a big thing about Buddhists and “no God.”  I am skeptical that Buddha did not recognize the existence of God.  He was often asked, “<font color="blue">Is there a God?” .. Does the soul exist after death?</font>”  And similar questions.  Buddha would never answer.  That did NOT mean he implied “no.”  Part of Buddha’s teaching was that each one must “be a light to himself,” that each one must find the truth in an experiential way.  He would say, “<font color="blue">Hey! don’t believe this or that because of ME.  No way!  You follow the 8-fold way that I’ve laid out and you will come to know the truth.</font>”<br><br>My second remark -- A short, true story -- I was spending a week as a guest with the Trappist monks in Massachusetts.  After we cleaned up after a good meal, a monk and I sat charring in the cleared refectory.  We shared a little about Buddhism.  I asked him, “<font color="blue">What is the rock difference between Christianity and Buddhism?</font>”  I looked forward to an involved discussion.  Without a moment’s hesitation he cut immediately to the heart of the whole thing, the monk instantly responded, “<font color="blue">Jesus Christ.</font>”  That was it.  At that time I was a little disappointed.  Several weeks later it suddenly occurred to me that was the best answer the monk could possibly have given.  Without Jesus Christ we are without the fullness of the choicest gifts God wants to give us.  With Jesus Christ only we have the very Fullness of God Himself -- as much as we are prepared or ready to receive it.<br>Every blessing, Ned.         John</span>

        June 13, 2009<br><br>Hi John,<br><br>If you haven't read Pope Benedict's &quot;Introduction to Christianity&quot; I highly recommend it. That book has had a lot to do with my personal return to faith in Christ and the Church. <br><br>In that book, the Pope talks about Being as Truth or the Logos. Being is eternal and omnipresent and I would add intelligent and living. Becoming, on the other hand, is temporal and singular. Along with that idea and what you said above, I was reminded of an insight I had quite a while ago.<br><br>We spend most of our lives trying to define who we are: &quot;I am (fill in the blank)&quot; and we all use that statement &quot;I am...&quot; <br><br>Whatever we finish off that statement with is bound to change and it is different for each one of us. There was a time before we were born when it could not be applied to us (because we didn't exist yet). And there will be a time after we are dead when it also would not apply. Yet, I AM was there before we were born, is here now and will be there after we are gone. No matter how we define it or how many times we change the definition it remains unchanged.<br><br>It is in that statement I AM that I station my faith. That may all sound very Buddhist, except that my experience has shown me that this I AM is a creative living Being and not a dead concept.It is loving because it begets all things. It is intelligent because all knowledge proceeds from it. <br>This is exactly how the Trinity is described. From the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02033b.htm" target="_blank">Athanasian Creed</a>:<br><br>The Father is made of none, neither created, nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created, but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father, and of the Son neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.</span>

        June 12, 2009<br><br>JMJ / MMM 090611 Thursday<br>Warm Greetings, NightSpirit -- and Everyone --<br>That Name God spoke to Moses, I AM, is so full, theologically and philosophically! I like to think of the burning bush story this way -- Moses is told to go preach and he's scared. Because a false prophet could be stoned to death. Moses asks, &quot;<font color="Blue">Lord, please tell me Your Name. They're gonna ask!</font>&quot; And God says to Moses the equivalent of, &quot;<font color="blue">I AM the One Who alone deserves to be said I Exist. I AM Utter Being. And you, Moses, little man, you are who doesn't exist. You have no name or existence apart from Me. So you tell them <b>I AM</b> Who Exists Necessarily and Absolutely. You go tell them THAT!</font>&quot; They couldn't have understood that, of course. Not at that time.<br>The preposition &quot;in&quot; has fascinated me for years. You quoted <b><font color="Black">John</font></b> 14:20, a further Divine mystery, &quot;<font color="Blue">In that day you will real-ize that I AM in the Father .. and that the Father IS in me .. and that you ARE in me .. and that I AM in you.</font>&quot; That quotation can't be paid proper attention except in a new thread. I have in mind to trigger off some good sharing with a new thread.<br>I also had an experience well over a half century ago -- for one single day -- that never repeated again. But it was a locking into position for me that could never be taken from me. It was a Divine Gift.<br>Blessing in Jesus Christ and in Mary! John</span>

        June 11, 2009<br><br>JMJ / MMM     090611  Thursday<br>Hello Brandon -- and Everyone --<br><br>Yes, I was quite serious when I wrote that Jesus Christ (One Person) has two intellects, two wills, two conscious -nesses -- a complete human psyche. I think it would be good for me to begin a new thread on this matter. I will do that here on CSF forum.<br><br>I like your phrase &quot;cosmic vending machine.&quot;  I also like &quot;Giant Bayer Aspirin.&quot; Even as a child I was taught (oh boy! from the old time Baltimore Catechism) that <font color="Red">PRAYER</font> meant <font color="Blue">1)worship</font>, adoration, praise / <font color="blue">2)thanksgiving</font> -- and I like to place love here, first love of gratitude and then love simply because God is God / <font color="blue">3)repentance</font> / and <font color="blue">4)petition</font>, first for our needs and then for our wants.<br><br>We, generally, need to learn what prayer is. And then the priorities of the kinds of prayer.<br><br>Despite some bad things, there were a lot of good and precious things about &quot;the old days.&quot;  People forget that if they have troubles at home with Mom and Dad and the relatives, it IS their home, it IS their family .. and its the same with the Church Christ founded. We must always say with Peter, &quot;<font color="blue">Lord, to whom shall we go?</font>&quot;<br>Blessing, dear friend Brandon!             John</span>

        <br><span class="subBodyText">
        June 10, 2009<br><br>Your phrasing was good, NightSpirit.  &#8220;<font color="blue">I believe God has revealed the truth in the Bible in encapsulated form and then reveals Himself, His truths, His secrets, further to those who seek Him out.</font>&#8221;  One or two points of polish.  According to the teaching of the Church there are two equally important sources of God&#8217;s Revelation .. Holy Scripture and the Church.  As spiritual children we grasp pretty much the surface of the truth, mostly in human terms we can understand.  As we respond to God with a good heart, the meanings of phrases and sayings comes clear.  And, yes, there are deep things of God that God shares with those who love Him much.  I wouldn&#8217;t call them secrets, though, because God&#8217;s Infinite Generosity wants to share His deepest truths with everyone -- but most are not ready for that.<br><br>Somewhere in the psalms it says, &#8220;<font color="Blue">God Spoke One Word .. I heard two.</font>&#8221;  I see in those words that God, in the Trinity, Spoke eternally the One Word, the Second Person .. Whom He also spoke in Jesus Christ.  God Speaks.  What is it I hear?  Two words?  Many, many words!  Over a lifetime I slowly, by God&#8217;s grace, join these words more and more into &#8220;phrases and clauses and sentences,&#8221; understanding more and more .. and approaching the total understanding in the One Word of God.<br><br>Jesus spoke to many &#8220;levels&#8221; of human beings at one time.  What a task!  And each heard, if he or she were listening, whatever he or she was capable of understanding at the time.<br><br>Regarding the first two chapters of <b>Genesis</b> &gt;&gt;&gt; The word &#8220;myth&#8221; can be used as a very powerful word, meaning the expression in story form of truths grasped, perhaps partially, by people who, because of the time in which they lived and the culture into which they were born, could absolutely not have grasped such truths in their purity, in their full meaning.  Such are the two different stories of Creation in <b>Genesis</b> 1 and 2.  Try explaining Einsten&#8217;s General Relativity to the six-year old living next door.<br><br>Those instances in which God is said &#8220;to have changed His Mind&#8221; &gt;&gt;&gt; From the first instant of Creation God Knew with certainty that He would &#8220;change&#8221; His Mind.  Actually it&#8217;s no change but simply the continuing fulfillment of what God has in control from the beginning.<br><br>And many times God makes <i>conditional</i> promises being dependent on a people&#8217;s continuing to cooperate with Him.  And these conditional promises are not always explicitly said to be conditional.<br><br>NightSpirit, it&#8217;s always enjoyable to share with you.  Keep worshipping, thanking, loving, repenting, and asking, in the Name of Jesus, for all your needs -- and, yes, for your wants.  Not all will be granted .. but God delights to see His children delight in truly good things.           John</span>

        June 10, 2009<br><br>JMJ / MMM     090610  Wednesday<br><br>Blessings NightSpirit -- and Brandon too (interested!) --<br><br>It would be indeed inaccurate to think of God as having real arms and legs, even feathers and wings.  Both from reason and from faith we can know that God is &#8220;Pure Spirit.&#8221;  The word &#8220;pure&#8221; here has no connection to matters sexual.  It means &#8220;all spirit and nothing but spirit.&#8221;  Reason alone can established this truth with certainty.  (I won&#8217;t begin to do that because we&#8217;ll get way off the track.)  When I speak of faith I mean a gift of believing matters of spirituality as guided by the Roman Catholic Church, the one founded by Jesus.<br><br>Oh, if God wanted to, of course God could take on whatever appearance He chose.  God very seldom does that.  Generally it&#8217;s an angel sent by God.  <br><br>One might think of &#8220;spirit&#8221; as all the life we have and far, far more .. AND without matter or emotion of any kind being involved.  Angels are &#8220;pure spirits&#8221; .. God is Pure Spirit.<br><br>A good purpose for adding the word &#8220;angry&#8221; would be to scare the pants of a rebellious and disrespectful people.</span>

        June 9, 2009<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by NightSpirit</div><br><br>We are so much in agreement here about it being unneccesary for God to go into a full explanation of everything. But I think his reasons for doing so are far greater than the limits of that society or the current scientific knowledge. <br><br>God can change His form as He did with Abraham or as He did with Moses, from a cloud by day and a fire by night. He can change his decisions as He did with Hezekiah. He can change His methods and symbols from animal sacrifices to the Lamb of God, from circumcision of the flesh to the circumcision of the heart. He can limit Himself, as in promising not to flood the earth again. He can change His own laws of physics and science when we pray.</blockquote><br><br>I think most of it was planned though. Remember that God knows everything; he just doesn't make decisions as events unfold.<br><br>Can you say more about Hezekiah? I'm not familiar with it, and that's the one thing that I can't really answer with this idea, when God, in the Bible, appears to change his mind.</span>

        June 9, 2009<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by NightSpirit</div><br><br>But would it be inaccurate to also assume from this verse that God actually can have arms, like a man? Taken with other verses, such as &quot;let us make man in our image&quot; and how in Genesis 18, the Lord appeared to Abraham in the form of a man, that would seem a fair conclusion.<br><br>Taking a verse literally like Psalm 91:4 - He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust - along with about 10 other verses in psalms, as well as Ruth 2:12, might lead one to believe God has feathers on His arms or wings instead of arms. Maybe He does or maybe not; whether we take it as stated or poetically, it really doesn't alter the intended truth in the verse, that He will protect us.</blockquote><br><br>This is a perfect example of how God discusses things according to our own experience in order to get a point across. Of course he really doesn't have arms, or wings for that matter, but it helps us to better understand what he is talking about. Again, the exact same thing Jesus did. Jesus is not actually a vine, obviously, but it helps us get a better picture of what he is talking about.<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by NightSpirit</div><br><br>In the one verse above, what would you think would be the beneficial effect of adding the word &quot;anger&quot; to that?

Please give me your thoughts.   <br><br>Is it figurative language also that the Holy Spirit can be &quot;grieved&quot; or that there will be a day for the &quot;wrath&quot; of God?</blockquote><br><br>Well, if someone's angry, aren't people going to be a lot more careful what they do? So much more if the one who is angry is God? People will say, &quot;we better do what he is saying.&quot;<br><br>I have a theory that every act of God, every merciful act and every punishment, comes directly out of his nature. It is what had to happen. From the beginning, he knew that Jesus would come to earth.</span>

        June 9, 2009<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by NightSpirit</div><br><br>I have always experienced God's love as unconditional, and believe that there is nothing we can do that will cause Him to love us less or nothing we need to do to earn His love. Having faith in that love really does set us free from fear, as in 1 John 4:18, &quot;perfect love cast out all fear.&quot; So I'm not afraid God will get angry with me. Maybe correct me or chastise me, even punish me, but never turn against me.</blockquote><br><br>Same here. <img src="/images/biggrin.png" border="0" alt="Big Grin" title="Big Grin"><br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by NightSpirit</div><br><br>I was talking to a friend about this. He said he also believes that God doesn't get angry, that when we read about the earth opening up and swallowing some people, it's not because God lost control or went psychotic. We agreed that God operates, in punishment, from a fairness or composure similar to what  we expect from our law enforcement officers and courts, to be able to maintain order, and execute force if needed, without resorting to emotions.</blockquote><br><br>That's interesting. It's also possible some of the more extreme punishments were exaggerated a little, but I'm not sure.<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by NightSpirit</div><br><br>I'm still thinking about this, whether it would be possible for God to experience empathy and compassion, sadness or anger, as Jesus did. Those emotions are certainly not sinful because Jesus was without sin and in all ways, pleased God. I see Jesus as a manifestation of God on earth so I believe He was operating in a godly way, even in His emotional responses.</blockquote><br><br>Here's the only part I disagree. I mean I agree Jesus was always operating in a godly way, of course. But again, jesus has a human and divine nature. Even if that human nature experienced emotion, it didn't affect the divine nature in the slightest. It is that divine nature that makes up the trinity, I believe.</span>

But like you said, that's another story or at least another thread. <br><br>I have been seeking God for more enlightenment on the original story and look forward to delving more into it here at a later time.<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by JohnJFarren</div><br><br>The key to the answer of the original question about God suffering essentially depends on the absolutely necessary truth that suffering involves change .. and on a (partial) understanding of the Incarnation.</blockquote><br><br>God can change His form as He did with Abraham or as He did with Moses, from a cloud by day and a fire by night. He can change his decisions as He did with Hezekiah. He can change His methods and symbols from animal sacrifices to the Lamb of God, from circumcision of the flesh to the circumcision of the heart. He can limit Himself, as in promising not to flood the earth again. He can change His own laws of physics and science when we pray.<br><br>Would He have to change His entire nature to feel empathy and compassion at the Crucifixion?  I'm not saying He was worried or wringing His hands, that He lost sight of the purpose of the cross, just that, at that moment, He may have cared and allowed Himself to be there and share the experience, instead of being disinterested or unaffected.<br><br>I'm willing to admit I may be missing something, especially considering the thought you've put into the question so thanks for your patience. <br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by JohnJFarren</div><br><br>Blessing to all!

        June 9, 2009<br><br><blockquote>Deuteronomy 29: 19 And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: 20 The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.</blockquote><br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by JohnJFarren</div><br><br>However, they are powerful and special ways of saying something.

It’s a manner of human speaking (under the inspiration of God) that is meant to add effect.</blockquote><br><br>In the one verse above, what would you think would be the beneficial effect of adding the word &quot;anger&quot; to that?

Or by using the words (which didn’t exist then and nor did their concepts) “prior” and “subsequent”?  No.</blockquote><br><br>We are so much in agreement here about it being unneccesary for God to go into a full explanation of everything. But I think his reasons for doing so are far greater than the limits of that society or the current scientific knowledge. <br><br>I believe God has revealed the truth in the Bible in encapsulated form and then reveals Himself, His truths, His secrets further to those who seek Him out.</span>

        June 9, 2009<br><br><blockquote>You wrote, “Jesus makes God personal.”  Yes, that’s quite true.  However God is quite Person, Personal, whether God ever became a human or not.

Jesus makes God <i>very</i> personal.<br>I am interested in your responses regarding these things.<br>Thanks for sharing.<br>John   (JohnJFarren)</blockquote><br><br>Well, I would say that God as the Father is a Person, that his creation has inherent meaning. As a part of his creation and made in his image, He couldn't be more personal to us. <br><br>What I was really commenting on here is the unique relationship that the Son establishes between humanity and God in comparison to other belief systems. <br><br>The God Vishnu took the incarnation of Krishna, but as this incarnation, he had a Mary Poppins version of Godhead. Krishna didn't weep. They didn't hang Krishna up on a cross. These aspects of Jesus make him very real... mainly that he suffered and died like all of us do. He knew ridicule and judgment. He knew loss. He also knew redemption, rejuvenation. This makes the whole drama of living meaningful. <br><br>Thanks for your comments John.</span>

        June 9, 2009<br><br><blockquote>Even without Christ, God is not an enigma.  We know about God in two ways, by reason and by Revelation.  Reason itself is able to establish with certainty the existence of God and God’s principal attributes.  Many people cannot do that.  Many people can.  I <i>know</i> it can be done simply because many years ago <i>I did</i> it .. and it’s been a part of me ever since.</blockquote><br><br>Well, I would point out that there was no time in creation where we were without Christ, being that he is co-eternal with the Father and the Holy Spirit. But I understand what you mean. <br><br>To comment on what you are saying, we know God as the Logos or Word or Truth and that Truth is Being itself. Since we are made in God's image, we use our <i>logos</i> to comprehend and commune with <i>the</i> Logos.<br><br><blockquote>Regarding God there are many things we do not know.  In these things we “are surrounded by doubt,” or at least we’re in the dark.  There are also many things we DO know about God .. and many of these things are accurate -- incomplete, out of focus, perhaps, little appreciated .. but nevertheless true.</blockquote><br><br>Without establishing faith first, it is impossible to know God. I think this is where a lot of people go wrong (including me). We say, &quot;I want to know you before I believe in you.&quot;     <br><br>I was meditating on the idea of &quot;begotten, not made&quot; earlier. The obvious meaning is that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary and not 'made' like the rest of us. On a deeper level, though, we keep trying to figure out the causality of Christ; how Christ is made. &quot;What are the steps? Give me a linear process to follow, so I can analyze the probable results.&quot; <br><br>It's not like that. &quot;Begotten&quot; is a direct, non-linear, non-causal relationship of the Father to the Son. And to know Christ means a sudden turn, a transformation of heart and mind, not an assembly line of salvation.</span>

There is a good bit we can and do know.<br>To separate the Christ from Jesus .. as you say you do .. is a mistaken approach.  Let us suppose &gt; I come upon you unexpectedly and I give your right hand a mighty whack!  You react instantaneously with, “Why did you <i>hit</i> me!”  <font size="1">(You might have reacted with, “Why did you hit my hand!”  But I doubt it.)</font>  Let’s stick with, “Why did you hit me!”  If I said that I didn’t hit <i>you</i>, I hit your <i>hand</i> .. my separating you from your hand would puzzle you a little.  As far as you’re concerned I did hit <i>you</i>.<br>In Jesus Christ there are not two persons.  There are two natures, the Divine Nature and a human nature, both possessed by the same One Person, the Second of the Trinity.  The human nature of Christ is possessed by, belongs to, the Second Divine Person in the same way your human nature is possessed by, belongs to, <i>you</i>, the one <i>person you</i>.<br>When one grasps strongly what this means, it truly takes an act of faith to believe it!</blockquote><br><br>I didn't mean by the above statement that there was one person Jesus and another person Christ. My apologies for not being clear.<br><br>To give an example of what I do mean, there is a man named Barrack Obama. He is a lot like other men. Similar set up. Yet the label <i>President </i>Barrack Obama adds an aspect to the personality of who this man is. It presents certain powers and a position of leadership. Even when Barrack is playing Candyland with his kids, he is still the Chief Executive Officer of the United States. His kids call him &quot;Daddy&quot; and his co-workers call him &quot;Mr. President&quot;, in either case the label does not diminish the actual personality behind the name. We are just referring to different aspects of the same man.<br><br>Similarly, many people  think of Jesus as a great man, a prophet, a teacher, a revolutionary, a healer, and so on. But to know him as Christ opens an entirely different aspect of Jesus' personality. As Christ Jesus, he is the eternal and only begotten Son of God; the way, the truth, the life. Now the teachings, words and actions of this simple carpenter that lived 2000 years ago have cosmic ramifications. And I agree with you, you can't really understand that without faith.</span>

        June 8, 2009<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by Rev. Brandon A. Olivares</div><br><br>Jesus could display emotion because he also has a human nature. Not to mention he was within time when he was on earth.</blockquote><br><br>I'm still thinking about this, whether it would be possible for God to experience empathy and compassion, sadness or anger, as Jesus did. Those emotions are certainly not sinful because Jesus was without sin and in all ways, pleased God. I see Jesus as a manifestation of God on earth so I believe He was operating in a godly way, even in His emotional responses. <br><br>I agree God is not bound by time but I guess I think He is not excluded from experiencing it either. Jesus became human and limited himself to a body for a time.  I see no reason God, the Father or God, the Holy Spirit could not experience time and emotions while not being bound by a body.....unless all that is done through Jesus. But then wouldn't it be possible that God would or could be experiencing emotions because the three are all one?<br><br>I guess it's a different discussion from whether God experiences emotions to whether God is moved or motivated by emotions and I guess I would agree that He is not. So it may not matter whether He can feel them or not.   <br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by Rev. Brandon A. Olivares</div><br><br> I'm interested what others think, though</blockquote><br><br>Yea, me too. Any discussion that gets me cracking the Bible looking for the answers is good for me. Thanks for your thoughts.</span>

        June 8, 2009<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by Rev. Brandon A. Olivares</div><br><br>OK, here's what I've come to.<br><br>We know that God is immutable. If anyone disagrees I can post some verses, but I think it is pretty well-known..<br><br>God has a nature. That nature includes love, mercy, justice, and so forth. This nature does not change. God is never not loving, not merciful, or not just (apologies for the double negatives).</blockquote><br><br>No need for verses for me. I agree that God does not and has not changed and that God IS love and that whatever He does is merciful and just.<br><br><blockquote><div>Originally Posted by Rev. Brandon A. Olivares</div><br><br>God, however, cannot have emotion because that would require him to be in a temporary state. God is outside of time, so he cannot change.</blockquote><br><br>That temporary state part and how it relates to emotions is what I still am mulling over in my mind. <br><br>I have always experienced God's love as unconditional, and believe that there is nothing we can do that will cause Him to love us less or nothing we need to do to earn His love. Having faith in that love really does set us free from fear, as in 1 John 4:18, &quot;perfect love cast out all fear.&quot; So I'm not afraid God will get angry with me. Maybe correct me or chastise me, even punish me, but never turn against me.<br><br>As an aside, knowing God is love is why I have never had a problem with the idea of hell. I don't think any of us really can know for sure what it is actually going to be like on the other side. But because God has been so merciful and loving to me, I trust He is and will be the same for everyone. Whatever place of punishment or justice that exists, I trust in God's wisdom and mercy that it is necessary.<br><br>Looking back at some of the events of the old testament that appeared harsh, I have been able to be more open to the deeper spiritual truths being conveyed, if I remember that God always operates from His good nature, just as you described Him.<br><br>I was talking to a friend about this. He said he also believes that God doesn't get angry, that when we read about the earth opening up and swallowing some people, it's not because God lost control or went psychotic. We agreed that God operates, in punishment, from a fairness or composure similar to what  we expect from our law enforcement officers and courts, to be able to maintain order, and execute force if needed, without resorting to emotions.</span>

        June 8, 2009<br><br>John,<br><br>That was a great post. Excellent explanation.<br><br>Yes, I think we have to take cultural influences and customs into consideration when interpreting the Bible. Certainly God would have had to communicate a certain way with the Jews to get the point across, just as the way the message is communicated has even changed since the time of Christ, up to today.<br><br>Just like how so many people have a problem with Vatican II because they think it changed a lot of things that shouldn't have been changed. Some people think it changed things that were unalterable truths in the Church. Really it just changed the presentation to make it a little more effective in communicating the message in our modern world, while the nature of that message all remained the same, because the truth itself never changes.</span>

        June 8, 2009<br><br>JMJ / MMM     090608<br>A Blessing on You, NightSpirit .. and Everybody --<br>What’s about “not literal”?  Examples= Oh, don’t beat around the bush!  There ain’t no bush.  And I’m not beating anything.  //  I’m gonna knock your block off!  You’d be arrested for nurder .. better not do it.  //  Said about somebody’s boss &gt; Boy! that guys a bear!  In actual fact, he’s not.  //  And .. she can wrap him around her little finger.  But you see the point.  In each of these statements there is meaning -- clearly understood.  You grasp the truth of them.  But taking each word at its face value .. they’re gibberish.<br><br>However, they are powerful and special ways of saying something.  The word “anthro” refers to man, to human beings.  There are times when Scripture speaks of God in terms of man, as if God were a human.being.  (We are not considering Jesus, True God and a true man, here.)  This is not a way of descendingly talking to dumb, little children.  It’s a manner of human speaking (under the inspiration of God) that is meant to add effect.<br><br>There is a time for “talking down” to people.  How should God have described the creation and formation of the world to the ancient Jews?  By explaining the Big Bang?  By explaining the relationship of matter to energy?  Or by using the words (which didn’t exist then and nor did their concepts) “prior” and “subsequent”?  No.  It was necessary to tell a story -- or not be understood at all -- of a man and a woman in a Garden with special trees and with a serpent who would talk and introduce a temptation.  It took many, many ages for that story to be properly understood.  For very many people, is that story understood today?  In its important, essential elements, yes.  But many people -- the security of their faith depends upon it -- take the story literally, word true for word true.  Well, that’s another story.<br><br>The key to the answer of the original question about God suffering essentially depends on the absolutely necessary truth that suffering involves change .. and on a (partial) understanding of the Incarnation.<br>Blessing to all!

        June 8, 2009<br><br>OK, here's what I've come to.<br><br>We know that God is immutable. If anyone disagrees I can post some verses, but I think it is pretty well-known.<br><br>God has a nature. That nature includes love, mercy, justice, and so forth. This nature does not change. God is never not loving, not merciful, or not just (apologies for the double negatives).<br><br>God, however, cannot have emotion because that would require him to be in a temporary state. God is outside of time, so he cannot change.<br><br>Jesus could display emotion because he also has a human nature. Not to mention he was within time when he was on earth.<br><br>That's just how I understand it. I'm interested what others think, though.</span>

        June 7, 2009<br><br>I could probably reflect on the meaning of the Trinity for the rest of my life and not know all the in's and out's of its significance.<br><br>When it comes to the suffering of Jesus and Jesus being God, I separate the Christ from Jesus to eliminate confusion (not as proper theology). <br><br>Christ is God in man. Jesus is man in God. Jesus Christ is the means through which man and God commune. It is through him that we are no longer separated from God and it is through him that God is no longer separated from us. <br><br>Without Christ, God is beyond our personal grasp. He is an enigma, an omnipresent, omnipotent Being that we can not see or know except through the impersonal observation of creation (his Spirit). And even in that observation, all we have is theory and speculation. We are surrounded by doubt. <br><br>Jesus makes God personal. There is an action required to know God on a personal level, which is faith in Christ's death and resurrection. Through that faith, the reality of the Father becomes clear.</span>

The information IS correct. I will search for and share some sources.<br><br>However -- I must try to do better than that.  I will locate exact treatment of <i>Communicatio Idiomatum</i> and post here website(s). AND -- apparently this other will take some time -- I'll locate more specific info relative to my first posting  .. and I'll share here in a posting.<br><br>I jumped into the swimming pool .. now I have to find my way to jump out.<br>Blessing and Love in Jesus Christ to Brandon and to you all.<br>John   (JohnJFarren)</span>

        June 7, 2009<br><br>JMJ / MMM     090607<br>Hi Brandon --<br>The backup you seek would not best be found in CCC but rather in more detailed and specific theological dogma manuals.

        June 7, 2009<br><br>Do you have a source from the Catechism backing you up on this?<br><br>I think I mostly agree, but as I think about it, I am not sure.<br><br>You do have a point that only Jesus has the human nature as well as divine.<br><br>However, there are many times in the Bible where emotions are attributed to God. God is angry, loving, merciful, etc. I guess the latter two are unchanging attributes, but there are many instances where it says about angering God.<br><br>This may just be our limited attempt at understanding it, so I am not exactly sure.<br><br>Good discussion, though.</span>
