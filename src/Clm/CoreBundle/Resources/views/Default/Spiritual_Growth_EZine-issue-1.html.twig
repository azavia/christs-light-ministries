With your help, <strong>Christ's Light Ministries</strong> will have a strong foundation that will develop into a great force for good in the world. This could not be done without your support, so I thank you.</p></p><p><p>And now, on to the first issue of <strong>Spiritual Growth E-Zine</strong>. I hope not to disappoint.</p></p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="new">What's New</h2></p><p><p>It's only the first week, and already we have so many great articles, many of which were submitted by our visitors. Just look at <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/prayers.html#VisitorPages">some of the great stories about prayer</a> submitted by our visitors already!</p></p><p><p>Especially popular has been <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/nam-yo-ho-renge-kyo.html">this story</a> of how a simple mantra healed Tarun's son from a serious sickness. Now, they chant it every day for continued wellness.</p></p><p><p>Just posted today, this story of <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/twelve-years-of-pain-and-hardships-gone-in-a-week.html">how Steve overcame his 12-year-long battle with rheumatoid arthritis in a week</a> through alternative, holistic healing is so inspiring. If you didn't believe in alternative healing before this, this might give you something to think about.</p></p><p><p>Another popular article on the site has been <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/who-is-god.html">"Who is God?"</a> I tell you what knowledge of God really means. Stay tuned, because I'll be adding more to this page soon.</p></p><p><p>Etyang wondered whether God can really be said to be a person, like so many theologians say He is. <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/is-god-a-person.html">Click here to see the full discussion.</a></p></p><p><p>If you're wondering whether God still answers prayers, <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/god-answers-prayers.html">Claudia seems to think so</a>. See her simple prayer to an annoying problem. Yes, God even cares about the minor things.</p></p><p><p>Also keep an eye on our page on <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/alternative-healing.html">alternative healing</a>. I outline my own experience and journey with it, though I will be adding more soon. Our visitors have also left some interesting contributions that shouldn't be passed over.</p></p><p><p>It seems that many people are really enjoying our articles, but sometimes people just want to work one-on-one with someone to work on improving their lives in a specific way, of course through the application of simple spiritual principles. This is why we've started offering <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/spz-spiritual-counseling">spiritual counseling</a>. It's my firm belief that anyone can have a better life, regardless of their current circumstances, if they can only begin to live a spiritual life centered around God. Christine and I can help you to do exactly this, and work through some particular issue in your life, or just work to have a better life overall.</p></p><p><p>Some people might not be quite sure yet about spiritual counseling. However, just about everyone needs healing in one way or another. We offer <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/sgz-holistic-healing">holistic healing</a> that heals body, heart, mind, and soul. In a healing session, old unresolved bonds, even from past lives, can be healed, so that you can be freer and experience less conflict in your life now. Emotional issues can be traced back to their source. Physical ailments can be alleviated if not healed outright, and you will have greater peace overall. This is something everyone can benefit from in one way or another, and I really recommend it even before requesting spiritual counseling in order to clear up any blockages, so make sure you <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/sgz-holistic-healing">schedule a session</a>.</p></p><p><p>Finally, for those who just simply need prayer, either for yourself or a loved one, we're now allowing people to submit a <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/sgz-request-prayer">prayer request</a>, either publicly or privately. If it is public, then other visitors can pray for you and give you encouragement. If it is private, then Christine and I will pray for you, or optionally, we can call you to pray for you over the phone or Skype.</p></p><p><p>Phew, that was a lot, and that wasn't even everything!

Indeed, that is the most important part of the spiritual journey. Without that, there is no journey to be had.</p></p><p><p>But what does this mean? How can you actually do this, and what effect does it have in your life? That's what I'm going to discuss.</p></p><p><p>Who is <em>God</em>? Obviously, God is He who created us. I use the word <em>He</em> for ease of speaking; God is really neither male nor female. God just is, and that is about the most that can be said of God. But in God's being, He is love. That is one of the major functions of God, and the one that we are most familiar with, though many people tend to twist it.</p></p><p><p>God's love is all-encompassing. There is nothing in the universe that God does not love. Yes, even the most evil person that you can think of, God still loves just the same as He loves you. Is that hard to believe? It's true. It can't be any other way.</p></p><p><p>So we have this God who loves us unconditionally. In fact, all love comes from God. What does this mean for us? If we want to live a life full of love, we have to become friends with God rather quickly. Without God, there is no love.</p></p><p><p>It's not because He's withholding anything from us. It's just that when we don't have a relationship with God, we are cutting ourselves off from what He has to give us. And what He has to give us is huge: love, goodness, happiness, joy, peace, abundance, and every other good and desirable thing. God is the only source of these things. Even those things in our world that seem to be loving, good, happy, joyful, peaceful, and abundant, are only so because they come from God. However, God is the perfect source of these things, and so can provide them without limit.</p></p><p><p>So, do you have a relationship with God? It's a real question that every person needs to ask themselves. Even for you who are on the spiritual path, sometimes you can miss the forest for the trees, and completely forget about God in your everyday life. What does it mean to have a relationship with Him?</p></p><p><p>Firstly, having a relationship with God does <em>not</em> mean to believe in God. Even evil spirits believe in God, possibly more than some humans do, yet they probably aren't on speaking terms with Him, do you think? Yeah, me neither. On the opposite end of the spectrum, atheists do not believe in God at all, yet they still are able to be loving, good, etc. So that's a dead end.</p></p><p><h3>1. A Relationship with God is Living Like God</h3></p><p><p>There are several aspects of having a relationship with God. The first aspect of it is to live like God. That is, live in alignment with the principles that God possesses. These principles include the ones that Jesus taught, like love of God and neighbor, doing good for others, etc.</p></p><p><p>How does this help us to have a relationship with God? Well, if you are <em>not</em> living according to these principles, then you are cutting yourself off from God even more.</p></p><p><p>It is as though you had a friend who was into the kind of things you are. You hung out together, watched sports together if you're into that kind of thing (I'm not), and in general had similar interests, so that there was always something to talk about. You were able to talk hours on end without running out of things to discuss, and you always had fun together.</p></p><p><p>Then, gradually, your friend got into some other activities that you didn't like so much. Maybe he got into drinking more than you liked or were comfortable with, and in general his standards became much less than your own, and he associated with people that you just didn't want to be around.</p></p><p><p>It would be no judgment on your own part, but just quite naturally you two would drift apart. You wouldn't have the interests your friend had, and your friend wouldn't have the interests you had. He'd associate with different people than you.</p></p><p><p>It's much the same with God. God is the same, always. He <em>never</em> changes, never. Of course, you <em>do</em>. What's this mean? As you become more and more like God, you are able to associate with God more and more. Not because God loves you any more or less, but because it's just more natural as you align yourself with principles that God possesses. On the other hand, if you drift away and start to do things opposed to these principles, then you won't find enjoyment anymore in being with God. A relationship with Him will seem like a bore, unnecessary, and stupid. Your life will similarly decline, because you cut yourself off from the gifts that God could give you when you associated with Him.</p></p><p><h3>2. A Relationship with God is Being With God</h3></p><p><p>Back to you and your friend. He's back now, and you're interested in the same things. However, he just never spends time with you. You might see each other at events you go to, and he is interested in all the same things - he even really likes and respects you. However, he just doesn't spend any time with you. Confusing, isn't it? What kind of friend would do that? Again, you end up just drifting apart, but you might not really know <em>why</em> you drifted apart.</p><p>Now you're friends with God. You are living like God, according to His principles, and you think it's important to have a relationship with Him. But then, you just go about your daily life like nothing happened. You read about spiritual things, try to live a moral life, maybe go to church (or… temple, etc) on Sundays if you're into worship services, and you might even say a quick prayer before bed. However, that's the end of your contact with God. You see Him here and there, around and about, but don't make any effort to sit down and have a chat, so to speak - try to catch up.</p></p><p><p>A relationship with God requires that you <em>be</em> with God. Again, this is going to take effort on your part, because He is always there, ready for you to come to Him. There's never a time when He's too busy or preoccupied like your friend in the example might be. It's all up to you.</p></p><p><p>Imagine this: if you take the amount of time that you pray, worship, or otherwise commune with God per week, and spend that much time with one of your best friends, would they still be your best friend? Would you still feel close to them?</p></p><p><p>God should be your <em>best</em> and closest friend. He should be more than that, of course, but I will discuss that another time. Does your time with Him reflect that? What can you do to better reflect the type of relationship you want to have with God?</p></p><p><h3>3. A Relationship with God is Listening to God</h3></p><p><p>Back to your hypothetical friend again. Now he's talking to you a lot more, which you are happy about. However, it is getting annoying because every time he is around, he only talks about himself. It seems like that is all he cares about. Moreover, he thinks that you can fix all his problems for him, and he won't try to do anything himself. Even if you wanted to, he doesn't let you have a word in edgewise to try to give him any advice, encouragement, or comfort. He just keeps complaining, asking for things, and talking about everything he needs but doesn't have.</p></p><p><p>You know where this is going, right? What do you do when you pray? Do you tell God everything that you need but don't have? Do you tell Him everything that's wrong with your life? Do you rant and rave about how many problems you have that He's <em>not</em> fixing? What do you do when you're done talking? Do you just get up and move on about your day? Do you shut God out, along with any solutions He might have, or any comfort He might be able to give you, expecting them to just show up magically?</p></p><p><p>God wants you to listen to Him. Not because he wants to tell you about what He's been up to - He doesn't <em>need</em> anyone. However, He hears your cries. He knows that you desire certain things in your life. He wants to give you peace. He wants to help you, but if you aren't trying to listen to His voice every day, He can't do that very effectively.</p></p><p><p>so many treat prayer as if it is just one-way. You talk to God, tell Him what you want or need, and that's it. However, a relationship, any relationship, has to be two-way. God is a faithful friend, and He wants to show you what He has to offer, especially if you've fulfilled the first two steps to the best of your ability. But if you don't listen, He can't. He won't push His way through the hubbub of your everyday life to try to give you a message. No, His silent inner voice is waiting for you to listen. Really, it is always speaking in your heart, but most of the day people aren't listening.</p></p><p><p>Ah, I hear protest. Some may ask, "How can I listen to God?" "God never speaks to me." "How do you expect me to hear God?" That's perfect, because it just so happens that the next section will give you some practical advice on this matter.</p></p><p><p>Before I move on, I again want to discuss those who do meditate, or perform any number of other spiritual practices. The danger here is to have spiritual pride. You might think that you don't need to hear any of this. You are already way beyond this. You talk to God over bacon and eggs every morning!</p></p><p><p><strong>Be careful!</strong> Spiritual pride is the most poisonous kind, when you think that you no longer need help, or can no longer improve. When you think this, that is how you know that you do need to improve.</p></p><p><p>It is very common to perform spiritual practices, but give very little thought to God Himself. You can meditate, yet never have a thought of God in your life. Even if you have a fairly good spiritual life, why not take this opportunity to evaluate your own spiritual journey, and pray for a renewal of your fervor? I think all of us could use that.</p></p><p><p>If you want prayer to help you on your spiritual path, please <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/sgz-request-prayer">submit a prayer request</a> Or, if you want one of us to work on healing and unblocking your obstacles that keep you from having a more fulfilling relationship with God, <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/sgz-holistic-healing">schedule an appointment for holistic healing</a>.</p></p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="practice">Practice: Hearing God's Voice</h2></p><p><p>So now you have a plan of action. YOu know where you are doing well, and probably know even better where you need to improve. But now we need to discuss how to get there.</p></p><p><p>God's voice speaks within your heart at every moment, but it is very silent. God rarely hits you over the head, unless it is something of grave importance. However, with most things, it is just a nudge here and a flash there. If you don't pay attention, you could completely miss them. Be careful that you aren't blocking it because you don't <em>want</em> to hear Him, for fear of what He might say.</p></p><p><p>Do you pray? Do you meditate? If you said no to both, then make an effort to begin today. There's no pushing off things like this to a better time. God is <strong>now</strong>. There is no time but now with God.</p></p><p><p>Take at least 5-10 minutes today and just pray. When you pray, don't only pray for yourself. Don't just tell God about everything that is wrong in your life, because when you do that, you tend to get more of the same. Tell God what's great in your life. Be genuinely happy and grateful for all of the great things that He has given you, like the roof over your head, the food you had to eat today, the clean water you were able to use, and the computer you're able to read this on.</p></p><p><p>If you must, let Him know about a few things you wouldn't mind having in your life. However, don't demand them. Come with the attitude that if you don't have them, that's fine, too. God should be enough to satisfy even the most thirsty soul. Do not pray as though you are lacking something, because you really are lacking nothing. You are a divine, beautiful, radiant creation of God, and there is no way that you could lack anything. But, if it is for the highest purpose of all, then pray out of the knowledge that it is already yours.</p></p><p><p>Also, pray for others. Pray for family, friends, and the random stranger you saw today who was frustrated about something. Pray about the person on the news tonight who was in an accident. Expand your horizon outside of yourself.</p></p><p><p>Only pray to God for about half of the allotted time. So, it must be between about 2.5-5 minutes.</p></p><p><p>Now, listen. You probably won't hear anything at first, but that's OK. Just relax, and <em>be</em>. Let your feelings come, and let them go. Let your thoughts come, and let them go. Tell God that you are ready.</p></p><p><p>Now, either mentally or physically record whatever feelings, thoughts, intuitive flashes, etc, you had that seem significant. Sometimes you may receive a message from god, and sometimes you may just receive a great feeling of peace, which of course is very beneficial in itself. You may think you received nothing, but you will <em>always</em> get something out of this exercise.</p></p><p><p>Practice this every day. If you have the time, do it twice a day, perhaps when you get up in the morning, and before you go to bed.</p><p><p>For those who already meditate, try to see how you can make it even more about God. Perhaps meet up with Jesus in your meditation and see what He has to say. Or, simply meditate on the power and the love of God. Feel His love all around you, and see what you receive.</p></p><p><p>Through this practice, you can learn to effectively communicate both ways with God, talking to him and listening to what He has to say. You may not get much at first, but within a few days you will definitely be getting something.</p></p><p><p>Of course, I have to hear about your experiences. I love these types of experiences with God. So, <a href="http://www.christs-light-ministries.org/who-is-god.html#INV">post your experiences here</a>. Then, others can gain encouragement and hope from your successes, or give advice and encouragement about your failures. We are all here for each other in this virtual spiritual community.</p></p><p><hr align="left" width="100%" size="1"></p><p><h2 id="donate">Support Our Cause</h2></p><p><p>Christ's Light Ministries is a simple site with simple beginnings, but with a big mission.
